A <B>sliding window</B> is an interval both of whose endpoints are allowed to move only forward, and never backward (or <I>vice versa</I>). It is analogous to an actual window that opens from left to right; when opening the window its left edge only moves to the right, and so does its right edge, and when closing it, the opposite is true. 
<P></P>
<P>However, in computer science, sliding windows are allowed to change in size as they are moving; the right edge may move without the left edge's movement, or <I>vice versa</I>. Notice that when the right edge moves, the window becomes larger, and when the left edge moves, the window becomes smaller.
