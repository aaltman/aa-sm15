<h3>Repetition is the key weapon against forgetting</h3>
<p>Everything you learn with SuperMemo will come back to you for review and repetition. Every day, you should review your scheduled portion of the learning material. Start with pressing <em>Ctrl+L</em>, or <em>Enter</em>, or choose <strong>Learn</strong> (if visible).</p>
<p>Press <em>Enter</em> to go from page to page. Sometimes, SuperMemo will ask you to grade yourself (e.g. <strong>Bright, Good, Pass, Fail</strong>, etc.). In such cases, click the grade that best reflects how well you remember.</p>
