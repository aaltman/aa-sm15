The Sleep Now mode is invoked by either the Wait For Interrupt (WFI) or the Wait For Event (WFE) instructions that immediately put the core into a low-power state pending an exception. The Sleep On Exit mode puts the system into a low-power mode as soon as it exits the lowest priority interrupt-service routine. The core stays in a sleep state until another exception is encountered. Since only an interrupt can exit this mode, the system state is not restored.

The NVIC also integrates a System Tick (SysTick) timer, which is a 24-bit count-down timer that can be used to generate interrupts at regular time intervals, proving an ideal heartbeat to drive a Real-Time OS or other scheduled tasks.
