<P>Accordingly, privileging sleeping with mutex locks seems like the systematic way to go. This choice, however, is not as simple as it looks. What really matters is not only the power consumption, but the amount of energy consumed for performing some work, namely energy efficiency. In the Figure 1 example, although the spinlock version consumes 50% more power than mutex, it delivers 25% higher energy efficiency (Figure 1(b)) for it achieves twice the throughput. Hence, indeed, locking is a natural place to look for saving energy. Yet, choosing the best lock algorithm is not straightforward.
