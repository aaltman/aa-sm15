<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">When JavaScript debuted in 1996, it added occasional interactivity and excitement to a web that was, up until then, composed of static documents. The web became not just a place to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; font-variation-settings: "slnt" -10'>read things</EM>, but to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; font-variation-settings: "slnt" -10'>do things</EM>. JavaScript's popularity steadily increased. Developers who worked with JavaScript wrote tools to solve the problems they faced, and packaged them into reusable packages called<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">libraries</STRONG>, so they could share their solutions with others. This shared ecosystem of libraries helped shape the growth of the web.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Now, JavaScript is an essential part of the web,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript" target=_blank>used on 98% of all websites</A>, and the web is an essential part of modern life. Users write papers, manage their budgets, stream music, watch movies, and communicate with others over great distances instantaneously, with text, audio, or video chat. The web allows us to do things that used to be possible only in native applications installed on our computers. These modern, complex, interactive websites are often referred to as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">web applications</STRONG>.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">The advent of modern JavaScript frameworks has made it much easier to build highly dynamic, interactive applications. A<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">framework</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is a library that offers opinions about how software gets built. These opinions allow for predictability and homogeneity in an application; predictability allows the software to scale to an enormous size and still be maintainable; predictability and maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of software.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">JavaScript frameworks power much of the impressive software on the modern web &#8211; including many of the websites you likely use every day. MDN Web Docs, which you are currently reading this on, uses the React/ReactDOM framework to power its front end.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; FONT-SIZE: 16px; FONT-FAMILY: Inter, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; COLOR: rgb(27,27,27); FONT-STYLE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; WIDOWS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255); TEXT-INDENT: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial' aria-labelledby=what_frameworks_are_out_there>
