<b> : </b>Use 4 threads to insert different number of nodes</H3>Then I fixed the number of threads and changed the number of nodes that each thread needs to insert. Combining results from the above two experiments, I noticed that when using 4 threads we have the largest differences for insertion and search. Therefore, I fixed the number of threads to 4 for this experiment. And I will use the set of data to roughly calculate the constants for Big-O nations of these two algorithms.<BR style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">
