<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">So what prompted the move to MDN? The short answer is that MDN and HTTP Observatory complement each other very well &#8212; they both have developer education and improving the health of the internet as core driving principles.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">The longer answer is that HTTP Observatory is a well-respected tool in the web and security communities, but it hasn't seen a major update for quite some time. Mozilla decided that the tool deserved to evolve and find new audience members to benefit from the security knowledge contained within.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">MDN is a popular site with a large audience of web developers who could benefit from this knowledge, so it seemed like a perfect new home. In addition, our team was very excited to update the tool's UI, functionality, and documentation, bringing it up-to-date and giving it some polish. This update was done in collaboration with Mozilla's Infrastructure and Security Risk teams; they provided expert advice to help us update the HTTP Observatory tests and documentation with confidence.</P>
