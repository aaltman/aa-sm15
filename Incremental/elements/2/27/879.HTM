Key-value stores are widely used as storage backends, due to their simple, yet flexible interface for cache, storage, file system, and database systems. However, when used with high performance NVMe devices, their high compute requirements for data management often leave the device bandwidth under-utilized. This leads to a performance mismatch of what the device is capable of delivering and what it actually delivers, and the gains derived from high speed NVMe devices is nullified. In this paper, we introduce KV-SSD (Key-Value SSD) as a key technology in a holistic approach to overcome such performance imbalance. KV-SSD provides better scalability and performance by simplifying the software storage stack and consolidating redundancy, thereby lowering the overall CPU usage and releasing the memory to user applications. We evaluate the performance and scalability of KV-SSDs over state-of-the-art software alternatives built for traditional block SSDs. Our results show that, unlike traditional key-value systems, the overall performance of KV-SSD scales linearly, and delivers 1.6 to 57x gains depending on the workload characteristics.</P>
