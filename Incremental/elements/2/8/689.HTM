<b> : </b>Ma's Algorithm</H3>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px">Ma's algorithm is built upon the basic sequential insertion algorithm with the addition of a "local area" concept and the use of lock-free primitives to control concurrency. And Ma also adds an extra<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">flag</I><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>field to each node to indicate whether a process gains control of the node, which is used for CAS operation check.
