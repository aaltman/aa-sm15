The publishing host could be a GitHub pages branch, a Netlify instance, or any private server of your choosing, for example. There are a number of advantages of this approach, mostly around performance (your user's device isn't building the page with JavaScript; it's already complete) and security (static pages have fewer attack vectors). These sites can still utilize JavaScript where they need to, but they are not<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; font-variation-settings: "slnt" -10'>dependent</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>upon it. Static site generators take time to learn, just like any other tool, which can be a barrier to your development process.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Static sites can have as few or as many unique pages as you want. Just as frameworks empower you to quickly write client-side JavaScript applications, static site generators allow you a way to quickly create HTML files you would otherwise have written individually. Like frameworks, static site generators allow developers to write components that define common pieces of your web pages, and to compose those components together to create a final page. In the context of static site generators, these components are called<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">templates</STRONG>. Web pages built by static site generators can even be home to framework applications: if you want one specific page of your statically-generated website to boot up a React application when your user visits it for example, you can do that.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Static site generators have been around for quite a long time, and they've recently seen a wave of renewed interest and innovation. A handful of powerful options are now available, such as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://astro.build/" target=_blank>Astro</A>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target=_blank>Eleventy</A>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://gohugo.io/" target=_blank>Hugo</A>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target=_blank>Jekyll</A>, and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target=_blank>Gatsby</A>.</P>
