<DIV class=section-content style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Frameworks allow you to write more declarative code &#8211; and sometimes<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; font-variation-settings: "slnt" -10'>less</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>code overall &#8211; by dealing with the DOM interactions for you, behind the scenes. This abstraction is great for your experience as a developer, but it isn't free. In order to translate what you write into DOM changes, frameworks have to run their own code, which in turn makes your final piece of software larger and more computationally expensive to operate.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Some extra code is inevitable, and a framework that supports tree-shaking (removal of any code that isn't actually used in the app during the build process) will allow you to keep your applications small, but this is still a factor you need to keep in mind when considering your app's performance, especially on more network/storage-constrained devices, like mobile phones.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">The abstraction of frameworks affects not only your JavaScript, but also your relationship with the very nature of the web. No matter how you build for the web, the end result, the layer that your users ultimately interact with, is HTML. Writing your whole application in JavaScript can make you lose sight of HTML and the purpose of its various tags, and lead you to produce an HTML document that is un-semantic and inaccessible. In fact, it's possible to write a fragile application that depends entirely on JavaScript and will not function without it.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Frameworks are not the source of our problems. With the wrong priorities, any application can be fragile, bloated, and inaccessible. Frameworks do, however, amplify our priorities as developers. If your priority is to make a complex web app, it's easy to do that. However, if your priorities don't carefully guard performance and accessibility, frameworks will amplify your fragility, your bloat, and your inaccessibility. Modern developer priorities, amplified by frameworks, have inverted the structure of the web in many places. Instead of a robust, content-first network of documents, the web now often puts JavaScript first and user experience last.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; FONT-SIZE: 16px; FONT-FAMILY: Inter, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; COLOR: rgb(27,27,27); FONT-STYLE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; WIDOWS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255); TEXT-INDENT: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial' aria-labelledby=accessibility_on_a_framework-driven_web>
