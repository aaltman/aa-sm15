<DIV class=section-content style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">In 2016, then-Mozilla security engineer<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://grayduck.mn/" target=_blank>April King</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=external style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://grayduck.mn/2016/08/25/observatory-by-mozilla-a-new-tool/" target=_blank>announced the original release of the HTTP Observatory tool</A>. Originally conceived as an internal testing tool to help Mozilla developers apply security best practices to their own websites, the HTTP Observatory was packaged into a website that anyone could use after April looked in dismay around the web and saw how few sites were applying those best practices.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">Since then, HTTP Observatory has exploded in popularity, with over 6.9 million websites being scanned a total of 47 million times! Mozilla's Infrastructure Security Team has regularly maintained the tool to improve the service, adding new tests as security best practices and standards are updated, and removing tests related to older technologies as they become obsolete.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 1px; MARGIN-LEFT: 1px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1px">That isn't the full story, however. The success of the HTTP Observatory hinges on two things.</P>

<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">First of all, the site gamifies the process of improving website security &#8212; each set of test results comes with a score and a grade, and developers over the years have shown great enthusiasm about achieving that sometimes-elusive A+ Observatory rating!</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Second, HTTP Observatory helps developers make sense of website security requirements &#8212; which can often be rather opaque and difficult to understand &#8212; by providing understandable feedback on how to fix issues highlighted by its dozen or so tests. Related documentation can be found all in one place.</LI></UL></DIV></SECTION><SECTION style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; FONT-SIZE: 16px; FONT-FAMILY: Inter, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Fira Sans", "Droid Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; COLOR: rgb(27,27,27); FONT-STYLE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; WIDOWS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255); TEXT-INDENT: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial' aria-labelledby=moving_the_http_observatory_to_mdn>
