Our design sensitivity analysis for MUTEXEE (not shown in the graphs) highlights three main points. First, spinning for more than 4000 cycles is crucial for throughput: MUTEXEE with 500 cycles spin behaves similarly to MUTEX. Second, the &#8220;wait in user space&#8221; functionality is crucial for power consumption (and improves throughput): If we remove it, MUTEXEE consumes similar power to MUTEX. Finally, the spin and mutex modes of MUTEXEE can save power on lengthy critical sections.
