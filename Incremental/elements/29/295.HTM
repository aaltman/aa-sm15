Many moms will swear their babies can sleep alone in a cot without any distress. And yet most behaviorists and anthropologists will agree:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>the mom and the baby should sleep in close contact</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>as it has been practised by the human race for millennia, and by nesting mammals for millions of years. There could be exceptions on health or safety grounds. However, for an average mom, sleeping with the baby should be a pleasure, a privilege and a duty. The young mom only needs to read about basic safety measures. For a baby, sleeping with the mom should be a basic human right! Many pediatricians, nurses, midwives and "old school" grandmas will still insist that the baby should sleep it its own bed for safety, discipline or convenience reasons. You may hear a medical professional advise: "<I>Don't reward the baby! You are making a rod for your own back</I>". This is very surprising in the light of the fact that baby reward system is pretty well tuned to satisfying its biological needs. An average adult with a number of control mechanisms messed up by the modern lifestyle should often be denied its rewards (a fat doughnut, a morning shot of whiskey, etc.). However, all natural rewards should be considered biologically advantageous for a baby. As for the safety issues, babies do die when sleeping with moms in soft beds, due to alcohol, etc. They do so too when sleeping alone. Simple preventive measures dramatically reduce the risks of the dreaded mishap. The idea that we should train up a child to sleep alone from birth is hard to uproot. One needs to look closely at the biology of breastfeeding and baby sleep to quickly realize that training up at that stage amounts to little less than cruelty (except for cases and moments where the baby does not seem to object sleeping in a cot or in mom's absence from the common bed). A little baby is basically a feeding, growing and learning machine. All its inborn reflexes are targeted at ensuring safety, growth, and brain development. The reflexes involved in rooting, sucking, and breastfeeding belong to the strongest drives in a little baby. A whole series of brain centers is involved and there is a close relationship between these centers, sleep centers, and the sense of well-being and pleasure. Even though the complexity of the mechanisms involved is far from being revealed to our understanding, denying a baby mom's breast and closeness is bound to have long-term developmental consequences. Metaphorically, you could try to put yourself in baby's boots by trying to sleep naked on cold concrete with horror movies blasting loud throughout the night. I might be overly dramatic here. If a baby goes to sleep on its own without much ado, its proximity craving is definitely not as powerful as described here. However, when a baby's growth is at stake, you should always err on the safe side. This is why it makes sense to assume the worst case scenario. I would not be surprised, if over time researchers discovered a need to extend the two-process model of sleep propensity in babies by a factor involved in breastfeeding. It has been shown that a tit is a soporific. I would not be surprised if it worked as an integral contributor to baby's<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><DFN><A title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#homeostatic_sleep_component"><SPAN title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary &#167;&#8198;homeostatic sleep component" style="COLOR: ">homeostatic</SPAN></A></DFN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>sleep propensity, or even a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><DFN><A title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#homeostatic_sleep_component"><SPAN title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary &#167;&#8198;homeostatic sleep component" style="COLOR: ">homeostatic</SPAN></A></DFN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>trigger, esp. at time where the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Circadian sleep propensity" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_sleep_propensity">circadian</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>cycle is not yet fully expressed.

Changing the sleep structure will affect neurogenesis (Stryker et al. 2001<SUP id=cite_ref-stryker-2001_8-0 class=reference style="WHITE-SPACE: nowrap; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; LINE-HEIGHT: 1"><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_sleep#cite_note-stryker-2001-8"><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" size=3 face=Arial>[8]</FONT></A></SUP>). In other words, any form of stress before or during sleep will affect baby's brain growth. This is why baby's sleep should be the zone of highest protection. Training up to sleep alone can wait.
