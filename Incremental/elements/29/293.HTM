Newborns are driven to sleep homeostatically, and woken up primarily by their feeding needs. Factors such as temperature, hunger, play, lighting, social interaction, etc. only add complexity to the picture. With a number of hard-to-predict factors that affect sleep needs, babies should always sleep on demand. If they want to play, the play should not be denied. All scheduling in their life should be done around their sleep. This basically means there are only two practicable solutions to newborn's good sleep:</P>

A mom needs to learn to adapt to periodic breastfeeding throughout the night. Mom's sleep will suffer a bit. However, with a bit of practice, breastfeeding can be minimally disruptive, and actually act as a soporific for both the baby and the mom. In other words, after a short breastfeeding session, both the mom and the baby should quickly fall asleep contented with the job well-done. Even though the development of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Circadian sleep propensity" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_sleep_propensity">circadian</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>cycle should proceed regardless, co-sleeping should assist that vital biological process.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>Baby safety issues related to sleeping together must be addressed beforehand</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(you can google for that in minutes:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class="external text" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: url(/skins/Vector/resources/common/images/link-external-small-ltr-progressive.svg?2cd31) right center; COLOR: rgb(51,102,187); PADDING-RIGHT: 1em; overflow-wrap: break-word" href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-sharing-the-family-bed_7753.bc">example</A>). Even a strong one year old can be suffocated easily. If you believe your power baby will scream or wriggle, it is not true! When its chest is compressed or breathing passages get obstructed, a baby will nearly instantly lose strength and be unable to defend itself! This is why safety is paramount. For a healthy and vigilant mother, statistics are good. A bit of anxiety at the start is unavoidable and perhaps good to develop healthy and safe sleeping habits. Psychologists, behaviorists and all open-minded pediatricians will all admit that the night-time bonding is great for baby's brain development. Perfect formula for both the mom and the child.</LI>
<LI style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.1em"><B>Emergency: Parental care in shifts with the help of breast milk</B>. It may happen that for health reasons, the mom and the baby should sleep separately for a while. In such cases both parents can still get excellent sleep if they adapt to a variant of shift-work with the help of chronotherapy. For example, one of the parents chronobiologically adapts to sleeping in the 7 pm - 1 am bracket, while the other takes the 1 am - 7 am shift. In the period when the mom is asleep, breast milk, extracted in advance (or formula) can be used instead of breastfeeding to avoid major disruptions to mom's sleep (remember that milk properties also change along the sleep-wake cycle). If that solution is not feasible for any reason parents will probably need to choose between:</LI></UL>

Sleep is vital for adult health. However, for a baby it is literally a matter of life and death as sleep disruption will have an effect on many causes of newborn mortality.
