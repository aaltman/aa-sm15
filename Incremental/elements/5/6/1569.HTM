<P>Abstract<BR>In the landscape of modern software development, the demand for scalability and resilience has become paramount, particularly with the rapid growth of online services and applications. Cloud-native technologies have emerged as a transformative force in addressing these challenges, offering dynamic scalability and robust resilience through innovative architectural approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive review of leveraging cloud-native technologies to enhance scalability and resilience in software development. The review begins by examining the foundational concepts of cloud-native architecture, emphasizing its core principles such as containerization, microservices, and declarative APIs. These principles enable developers to build and deploy applications that can dynamically scale based on demand while maintaining high availability and fault tolerance. Furthermore, the review explores the key components of cloud-native ecosystems, including container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, which provide automated management and scaling of containerized applications. Additionally, it discusses the role of service meshes in enhancing resilience by facilitating secure and reliable communication between microservices. Moreover, the paper delves into best practices and patterns for designing scalable and resilient cloud-native applications, covering topics such as distributed tracing, circuit breaking, and chaos engineering. These practices empower developers to proactively identify and mitigate potential failure points, thereby improving the overall robustness of their systems. This review underscores the significance of cloud-native technologies in enabling software developers to build scalable and resilient applications. By embracing cloud-native principles and adopting appropriate tools and practices, organizations can effectively meet the evolving demands of modern software development in an increasingly dynamic and competitive landscape.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Introduction<BR>Cloud-native technologies encompass a set of methodologies, practices, and tools that optimize application development, deployment, and management for cloud environments (Tundo et al., 2024). At its core, cloud-native emphasizes building applications as collections of loosely coupled, independently deployable services that leverage cloud-native infrastructure and services (Alonso et al., 2023). It includes principles such as containerization, microservices architecture, declarative APIs, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code</P>
