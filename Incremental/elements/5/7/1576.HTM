Semantics and Intuitions<BR>Paxos:<BR>Semantics: Paxos is fundamentally about reaching agreement in a network of unreliable components. It ensures that a single value is agreed upon among the participants, even if some of them fail.<BR>Intuition: Imagine a group of people trying to decide on a place to eat. They propose options and vote, ensuring they eventually agree on one place, even if some members are indecisive or change their minds. The key is that once a decision is made, it&#8217;s final.<BR>Raft:<BR>Semantics: Raft&#8217;s primary goal is to simplify the consensus process. It breaks down the process into smaller subproblems.<BR>Intuition: Picture a classroom where students elect a class representative. This representative then takes decisions on behalf of the class, ensuring everyone&#8217;s on the same page. If the representative is absent, a new one is elected.<BR>ZAB (Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast):<BR>Semantics: ZAB is about total order broadcast. It ensures all actions are executed in the same order across all nodes.<BR>Intuition: Think of a series of tasks that need to be executed in a specific sequence. ZAB ensures that this sequence is maintained across all nodes, ensuring consistency.<BR>Technicals<BR>Paxos:<BR>Phases: Paxos operates mainly in two phases &#8212; Prepare and Accept. The Prepare phase is about proposing a value, and the Accept phase is about agreeing on it.<BR>Multi-Paxos: An optimization where one node remains the leader until it fails, reducing the number of messages. This is especially useful in systems where leadership changes are costly.<BR>Advantages: Proven correctness and wide applicability. It&#8217;s a foundation for many other consensus algorithms.<BR>Disadvantages: Its complexity makes it hard to implement and understand. Many systems opt for simpler algorithms due to this.<BR>Raft:<BR>Leader Election: Raft has a unique approach to leader election. A new leader is elected whenever the current one fails. This ensures system availability.<BR>Log Replication: The leader is responsible for log replication. It ensures that all logs are consistent across nodes.<BR>Advantages: Its main advantage is its simplicity. It&#8217;s easier to understand and implement than Paxos.<BR>Disadvantages: Some argue it&#8217;s not as generalized as Paxos. However, its simplicity often outweighs this disadvantage.<BR>ZAB:<BR>Election Phase: A leader is elected. This is crucial for the subsequent phases.<BR>Discovery Phase: The leader establishes synchronization with all followers. This ensures that all nodes start from a consistent state.<BR>Broadcast Phase: The leader broadcasts client updates. This ensures that all nodes have the same data.<BR>Advantages: Tailored for ZooKeeper&#8217;s needs, ensuring strong consistency.<BR>Disadvantages: It&#8217;s specific to ZooKeeper&#8217;s use case. This might make it less suitable for other applications.<BR>Real-life Use Cases<BR>Paxos:<BR>Distributed Databases: Systems like Google&#8217;s Spanner employ Paxos for global consistency. It ensures that data is consistent across global data centers.<BR>Configuration Management: Chubby, a lock service by Google, uses Paxos. It ensures that configuration data is consistent.<BR>Raft:<BR>Storage Systems: CockroachDB, a distributed SQL database, uses Raft. It ensures data consistency across nodes.<BR>Service Orchestration: Kubernetes, the container orchestration system, employs etcd which uses Raft. It ensures that configuration data is consistent across nodes.<BR>ZAB:<BR>Distributed Coordination: Apache ZooKeeper, which uses ZAB, is pivotal for systems like Kafka. It ensures that nodes in a distributed system coordinate effectively.<BR>Open-source Projects<BR>Paxos:<BR>OpenPaxos: A robust open-source Paxos implementation. It&#8217;s a great starting point for those looking to understand Paxos.<BR>Raft:<BR>etcd: A consistent key-value store. It&#8217;s widely used in cloud-native applications.<BR>raft-rs: Raft implemented in Rust. It&#8217;s a part of the TiKV project.<BR>ZAB:<BR>Apache ZooKeeper: The primary user of ZAB. It&#8217;s a must-know for anyone working with distributed systems.
