<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">For argument sake, let&#8217;s say you are an effective EM so your path to Sr. EM is keep doing what you are doing to show you have a consistent track record of execution.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px">MoM: At this point you are one level up from the daily EM grunt work(like attending stand ups, Sprint planning etc but for example attend the retros to tune in and hear from the team first hand) some basic things you have to be good at -</P>

<LI style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px">
<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Letting go your lego: you have to get really good at giving away your job duties. Sometimes this is to a tech lead or an EM who you are actively mentoring. So have a framework for evaluating/nurturing such talent. This is easier said than done.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Influencing and coaching the team by asking the right questions. This is usually not by giving them answers on how you would built or run something. This is an art that can take ears to learn and master. There&#8217;s an emotional aspect to doing this and you have to sometimes stop yourself from the urge of solving it for the team and let the team figure it out (ofcourse without burning their hands or the business).</P></LI>
<LI>
<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">IMO, this position is another inflection point in ones management/leadership career. You are an alignment conduit between the senior leadership and EMs and the engineers. You should be spending a ton of your time on aligning on the priorities etc. and not so much on the execution.(this may also depend on your company/org)</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">You will have a few IC leaders(like Staff) reporting to you. How does 4. tie into bigger picture technical initiatives in the company. You can at it&#8217;s core influence these initiatives to solve for current/future problems (ex: limitations of the tech stack hindering x, y product capabilities that can generate revenue)</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Same as 2, Identifying and mentoring and coaching other IC&#8217;s who aspire to be EM&#8217;s(beaware some IC&#8217;s tend to confuse EMship with having authority which may or may not be the case). Another skill that goes a long way is can you successfully manage IC&#8217;s who are technically more knowledgeable than you.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Your product counterparts rave about working with you. (You speak their language, keep things simple for them, collab with them on 1pagers etc for the shared discovery of strategy/vision)</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Congrats now you are a Director. So this usually means you are a rockstar at most of the things that qualify being a MoM above. Note that the most is bolded. At this position it is more about leadership than about management.</P>
