I'm sure you experienced this becoming a front line manager - when you're no longer hands on coding you have to wield new types of influence to get your team to get work done "correctly" and on time. This gets amplified when your direct reports are managers and not engineers.</P>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Learn how to communicate technical concepts with non-technical people. You will spend a lot of time explaining to and negotiating with non-technical stakeholders. You will have to be effective at both understanding their business goals, and advocating purely technical work. This is more art than science and takes practice.</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Up-level your conflict resolution skills. At this level the conflicts you will be asked to deal with are no longer within your team, but across teams and disciplines. This can be very fatiguing but is critical to being effective at having your team(s) working efficiently.</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Get more comfortable and creative with solving vague/loosely defined problems. You will be tasked with solving "business problems" instead of "delivering projects/features". And along this same vein, the nature of your work will inherently become less technical as you offload the technical thinking to other managers and senior engineers. Your work will be more focused on process and organizational issues. Think long and hard about if that's for you or not. Some people love front line management because they're still in the weeds on technical problems. That type of satisfaction and glory will become less frequent the more you move up in management.</P></LI>

<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px">Become really really really good at recruiting. Your biggest problem will quickly become that your team isn't staffed up enough/with the right people and if you're not good at recruiting then you're in for a bad time.</P></LI></UL>
