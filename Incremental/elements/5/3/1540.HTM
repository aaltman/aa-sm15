Abstract<BR>Leader-based consensus algorithms are fast and efficient un- der normal conditions, but lack robustness to adverse condi- tions due to their reliance on timeouts for liveness. We present QuePaxa, the first protocol offering state-of-the-art normal- case efficiency without depending on timeouts. QuePaxa uses a novel randomized asynchronous consensus core to tolerate adverse conditions such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, while a one-round-trip fast path preserves the normal-case efficiency of Multi-Paxos or Raft. By allowing simultaneous proposers without destructive interference, and using short hedging delays instead of conservative timeouts to limit re- dundant effort, QuePaxa permits rapid recovery after leader failure without risking costly view changes due to false time- outs. By treating leader choice and hedging delay as a multi- armed-bandit optimization, QuePaxa achieves responsiveness to prevalent conditions, and can choose the best leader even if the current one has not failed. Experiments with a prototype confirm that QuePaxa achieves normal-case LAN and WAN performance of 584k and 250k cmd/sec in throughput, respec- tively, comparable to Multi-Paxos. Under conditions such as DoS attacks, misconfigurations, or slow leaders that severely impact existing protocols, we find that QuePaxa remains live with median latency under 380ms in WAN experiments.<BR>1&nbsp;Introduction<BR>In widely-deployed state machine replication (SMR) proto- cols [64, 75], a fault-tolerant group of distributed replicas use consensus [16, 42] to agree on a strongly-ordered series of states.

First, because most practical consensus algorithms are leader-driven, they rely on partial- synchrony assumptions and timeout-triggered view changes for availability, and may lose liveness under adverse network conditions. Second, because simultaneous leaders interfere destructively and view changes incur high costs, timeouts must be chosen conservatively large to avoid false triggers and maintain performance. Third, timeouts incur the adminis- trative cost of careful manual configuration, and mistakes can lead to poor performance or complete outages. Can practical SMR systems escape the tyranny of timeouts?<BR>We introduce QuePaxa, a novel approach to consensus and SMR that confronts these issues. QuePaxa seeks to ensure robust availability and performance under diverse conditions such as transient slowdowns, targeted denial-of-service at- tacks, or misconfigurations. In brief, QuePaxa achieves robust- ness by (1) leveraging randomized asynchronous consensus to guarantee liveness under worst-case conditions; (2) relying on hedging [23, 71] instead of timeouts to gain efficiency com- parable to leader-based protocols under normal conditions; and (3) adaptively choosing leaders and hedging schedules to mitigate the costs and risks of manual configuration.<BR>Asynchronous consensus algorithms have long held promise to avoid relying on timeouts for liveness [2, 14, 29], and to tolerate arbitrary network conditions including targeted denial-of-service attacks. Under normal conditions, however, asynchronous algorithms are usually much less efficient than partially-synchronous algorithms. QuePaxa introduces a novel asynchronous crash-stop consensus protocol that randomly prioritizes proposals to circumvent the FLP theorem [27] and guarantees commitment in a few round-trips with high probability. To avoid the traditional efficiency costs of asyn- chronous consensus, QuePaxa supports a fast path allowing a designated leader to commit in a single round-trip merely by adjusting its priority selection, thereby achieving normal-case efficiency comparable to partially-synchronous protocols.<BR>Timeouts in traditional protocols must be set conserva- tively large to avoid false triggers, because simultaneous proposers destructively interfere with each other, prevent- ing either from progressing, and unnecessary view changes are costly. Due to QuePaxa&#8217;s asynchronous core, however, simultaneous proposers not only do not interfere destructively, but can even cooperatively help each other decide faster. In
