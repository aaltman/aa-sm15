Going Beyond an Incident Report with TLA+<BR>Finn Hackett, Joshua Rowe, Markus Alexander Kuppe July 27, 2023<BR>Abstract<BR>Incident reports describe what happened when a system&#8217;s performance was degraded, or when it stopped working entirely. They document the measurements made, the changes applied in order to rectify the problem, and the contributing factors identified. What they don&#8217;t do is help us think beyond those facts. Human reasoning capability is limited, and site reliability engineers can benefit from automated reasoning technology just as much as system developers.<BR>We propose that modeling techniques, which are normally used during system design to predict and avoid incidents, are just as valuable after the fact. Modeling allows site reliability engineers to go beyond a prose-and- figures incident reports and produce precise, interactive and analyzable models of incidents. We back up these claims by demonstrating our analysis of a 28-day outage at Microsoft and show the added clarity gained by building a model of what happened. All of the models used in our demonstration are released as open-source.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Proposed Workflow<BR>We propose an extension to the traditional incident workflow that incorporates modeling the behaviors involved via a specification language designed for use with concurrent and distributed systems. In many cases, this can lead to greater understanding of the factors that contributed to the incident, as well as providing a mechanism to explore the effectiveness of proposed strategies for preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.</P>
