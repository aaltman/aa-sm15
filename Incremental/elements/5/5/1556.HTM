<b> : </b><SPAN><SPAN>The Laser of Death</SPAN></SPAN></H3>
<P><SPAN>In load balanced systems, we often use health checks to determine which backends can serve requests. This works well most of the time &#8212; we avoid sending requests to instances that are temporarily overloaded or have just been turned down. However, health checks can sometimes make an overload situation worse by causing a phenomenon affectionately called the &#8216;Laser of Death&#8217;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>In a system that is under significant but manageable load, a subset of instances become unhealthy for some reason. Load balancers stop sending requests to those instances, and instead, send slightly more load to other instances. Load balancing is never quite perfect, and a couple of these instances now become overloaded, and fail their health checks, resulting in more load to the remaining healthy instances, some of which in turn become overloaded. The load balancers can start to act as a &#8216;laser of death&#8217;, overloading whichever subset of hosts is currently passing health checks. This is an example of a case where the health checking signal has become unhelpful because the load balancing (driven by health checking) is actually causing the health check signals to change state, because of overload.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>There are mechanisms to avoid this kind of failure: various kinds of circuit-breaking or loadshedding approaches are possible. Envoy Proxy has a mechanism called &#8216;panic routing&#8217; which sets a threshold percentage of healthy hosts. If the percentage of healthy hosts in a particular cluster drops below the threshold, Envoy will begin to ignore health check status and load balance equally across all hosts in the cluster.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
