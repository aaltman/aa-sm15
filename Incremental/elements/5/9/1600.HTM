Another potential route to go [AA: besides&nbsp;tbb::concurrent_priority_queue]&nbsp;is concurrent ordered skip-lists. Skip-lists are randomized, so no need for global repair/rebalance operations that are required for heaps/trees. Enqueues are naturally distributed (=scalable) over the whole skip-list; however dequeue operations are all happen at list head (=!scalable) (can be made lockfree, though, but that's not a panacea).
