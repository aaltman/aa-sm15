We may force each WAL update (record of which operation we execute) to the disk, for durability. This is smaller than forcing the entire state or physical block to the disk. But flushing every WAL update (or at least WAL updates for a transaction before commit) adds stall. Can we do better? What is the most performant (avoiding I/O stalls) way that we can still achieve durability?<BR><BR>ARIES gets us there. It doesn't leave anything on the table.
