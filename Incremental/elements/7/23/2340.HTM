ICPC: "a few rules of thumb can be used to identify Complete Search problems:</P>
<P>&nbsp;- asks to print all answers and the solution space can be as big as the search space</P>
<P>&nbsp;- has small search space (the total operations in the worst case is &lt; 100M)</P>
<P>&nbsp;- has suspiciously large time limit constraint and has lots of (early) pruning potentials</P>
<P>&nbsp;- can be pre-calculated</P>
<P>&nbsp;- is a known NP-hard/complete problem without any special property"
