Given differing production environments and workloads, many users like to run benchmarking tests for purposes such as optimizing for throughput or for capacity planning.</P>

The experiments focus on system throughput and system latency, as these are the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production. In particular, the throughput test measures how efficient Kafka is in utilizing the hardware, specifically the disks and the CPU. The latency test measures how close Kafka is to delivering real-time messaging including tail latencies of up to p99.9th percentile, a key requirement for real-time and mission-critical applications as well as microservices architectures.
