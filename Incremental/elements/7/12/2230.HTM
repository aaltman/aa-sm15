The word "intrusive" when describing a data structure refers to data about storage, such as its place in a lock-free queue, being stored "intrusively" within the data structure itself.&nbsp; The opposite is "non-intrusive" in which storage-related data is stored outside of the structure being referred to.&nbsp;
