<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>The main benefit of an error budget is that it provides a common incentive that allows both product development and SRE to focus on finding the right balance between innovation and reliability.</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>Many products use this control loop to manage release velocity: as long as the system&#8217;s SLOs are met, releases can continue. If SLO violations occur frequently enough to expend the error budget, releases are temporarily halted while additional resources are invested in system testing and development to make the system more resilient, improve its performance, and so on. More subtle and effective approaches are available than this simple on/off technique:<SUP style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255); LINE-HEIGHT: 0"><A id=id-bb2umSeIPu8iV-marker class=jumptarget style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255); OUTLINE-WIDTH: 0px; OUTLINE-STYLE: none; OUTLINE-COLOR: invert" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/#id-bb2umSeIPu8iV" data-type="noteref">15</A></SUP><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>for instance, slowing down releases or rolling them back when the SLO-violation error budget is close to being used up.</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">For example, <FONT class=extract>if product development wants to skimp on testing or increase push velocity and SRE is resistant, the error budget guides the decision. When the budget is large, the product developers can take more risks. When the budget is nearly drained, the product developers themselves will push for more testing or slower push velocity, as they don&#8217;t want to risk using up the budget and stall their launch. In effect, the product development team becomes self-policing. They know the budget and can manage their own risk. (Of course, this outcome relies on an SRE team having the authority to actually stop launches if the SLO is broken.)</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>What happens if a network outage or datacenter failure reduces the measured SLO? Such events also eat into the error budget. As a result, the number of new pushes may be reduced for the remainder of the quarter. The entire team supports this reduction because everyone shares the responsibility for uptime.</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>The budget also helps to highlight some of the costs of overly high reliability targets, in terms of both inflexibility and slow innovation. If the team is having trouble launching new features, they may elect to loosen the SLO (thus increasing the error budget) in order to increase innovation.</FONT></P><ASIDE id=key-insights-EDSWceuYiM class=highlight style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 80px; BACKGROUND: rgb(245,245,245); PADDING-BOTTOM: 60px; PADDING-TOP: 60px; PADDING-LEFT: 60px; PADDING-RIGHT: 60px" data-type="sidebar">
