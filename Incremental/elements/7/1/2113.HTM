<b> : </b>Types of failures</H3>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">The low-latency user wants Bigtable&#8217;s request queues to be (almost always) empty so that the system can process each outstanding request immediately upon arrival. (Indeed, inefficient queuing is often a cause of high tail latency.) The user concerned with offline analysis is more interested in system throughput, so that user wants request queues to never be empty. To optimize for throughput, the Bigtable system should never need to idle while waiting for its next request.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">As you can see, success and failure are antithetical for these sets of users. Success for the low-latency user is failure for the user concerned with offline analysis.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=cost-vJskhPhecQ data-type="sect3">
