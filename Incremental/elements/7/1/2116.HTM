<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Other chapters in this book discuss how tensions can arise between product development teams and SRE teams, given that they are generally evaluated on different metrics. Product development performance is largely evaluated on product velocity, which creates an incentive to push new code as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, SRE performance is (unsurprisingly) evaluated based upon reliability of a service, which implies an incentive to push back against a high rate of change. Information asymmetry between the two teams further amplifies this inherent tension. The product developers have more visibility into the time and effort involved in writing and releasing their code, while the SREs have more visibility into the service&#8217;s reliability (and the state of production in general).</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">These tensions often reflect themselves in different opinions about the level of effort that should be put into engineering practices. The following list presents some typical tensions:</P>

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">How hardened do we make the software to unexpected events? Too little, and we have a brittle, unusable product. Too much, and we have a product no one wants to use (but that runs very stably).</DD>
<DT id=testing class="subheaders jumptargets" style="FONT-SIZE: 32px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px; FONT-FAMILY: Roboto; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; COLOR: rgb(66,66,66); LINE-HEIGHT: 44px">Testing</DT>
<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">Again, not enough testing and you have embarrassing outages, privacy data leaks, or a number of other press-worthy events. Too much testing, and you might lose your market.</DD>

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">Every push is risky. How much should we work on reducing that risk, versus doing other work?</DD>

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">It&#8217;s a best practice to test a new release on some small subset of a typical workload, a practice often called<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">canarying</EM>. How long do we wait, and how big is the canary?</DD></DL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Usually, preexisting teams have worked out some kind of informal balance between them as to where the risk/effort boundary lies. Unfortunately, one can rarely prove that this balance is optimal, rather than just a function of the negotiating skills of the engineers involved. Nor should such decisions be driven by politics, fear, or hope. (Indeed, Google SRE&#8217;s unofficial motto is "Hope is not a strategy.") Instead, our goal is to define an objective metric, agreed upon by both sides, that can be used to guide the negotiations in a reproducible way. The more data-based the decision can be, the better.</P><SECTION id=forming-your-error-budget-vJs8iDio data-type="sect2">
