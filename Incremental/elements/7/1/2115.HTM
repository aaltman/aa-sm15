<b> : </b>Example: Frontend infrastructure</H3>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">To demonstrate that these risk-tolerance assessment principles do not just apply to storage infrastructure, let&#8217;s look at another large class of service: Google&#8217;s frontend infrastructure. The frontend infrastructure consists of reverse proxy and load balancing systems running close to the edge of our network. These are the systems that, among other things, serve as one endpoint of the connections from end users (e.g., terminate TCP from the user&#8217;s browser). Given their critical role, we engineer these systems to deliver an extremely high level of reliability. While consumer services can often limit the visibility of unreliability in backends, these infrastructure systems are not so lucky. If a request never makes it to the application service frontend server, it is lost.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">We&#8217;ve explored the ways to identify the risk tolerance of both consumer and infrastructure services. Now, we&#8217;ll discuss using that tolerance level to manage unreliability via error budgets.</P></SECTION></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION id=xref_risk-management_unreliability-budgets data-type="sect1">
