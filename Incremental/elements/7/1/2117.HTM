<b> : </b>Forming Your Error Budget</H2>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">In order to base these decisions on objective data, the two teams jointly define a quarterly error budget based on the service&#8217;s service level objective, or SLO (see<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/" data-type="xref">Service Level Objectives</A>). The error budget provides a clear, objective metric that determines how unreliable the service is allowed to be within a single quarter. This metric removes the politics from negotiations between the SREs and the product developers when deciding how much risk to allow.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Our practice is then as follows:</P>
<UL style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 55px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Product Management defines an SLO, which sets an expectation of how much uptime the service should have per quarter.</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">The actual uptime is measured by a neutral third party: our monitoring system.</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">The difference between these two numbers is the "budget" of how much "unreliability" is remaining for the quarter.</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">As long as the uptime measured is above the SLO&#8212;in other words, as long as there is error budget remaining&#8212;new releases can be pushed.</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">For example, imagine that a service&#8217;s SLO is to successfully serve 99.999% of all queries per quarter. This means that the service&#8217;s error budget is a failure rate of 0.001% for a given quarter. If a problem causes us to fail 0.0002% of the expected queries for the quarter, the problem spends 20% of the service&#8217;s quarterly error budget.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=benefits-lqsduViV data-type="sect2">
