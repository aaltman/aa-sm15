<B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Principle 2.</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Repeating history during Redo: On restart after a crash, ARIES retraces the actions of a database before the crash and brings the system back to the exact state that it was in before the crash. Then it undoes the transactions that were still active at crash time, because these transactions did not get to commit and need to be rollback. &nbsp;
