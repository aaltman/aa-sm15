But in practice these lower bounds do not present a real barrier as spending a cache line or exclusive reservation granule (up to 2&nbsp;KB on ARM) of store per thread in the shared memory is not considered too costly for practical fsystems (typically the amount of store logically required is a word, but physically CAS operations on the same cache line will collide, and LL/SC operations in the same exclusive reservation granule will collide, so the amount of store physically required<SUP class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="FONT-SIZE: 12px; WHITE-SPACE: nowrap; LINE-HEIGHT: 1">[<I><A title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: ; border-radius: 2px; overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><SPAN title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
