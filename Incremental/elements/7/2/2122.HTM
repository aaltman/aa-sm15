The Circuit Breaker Pattern works by monitoring the health of a service [20]. A circuit breaker has 3 states shown in Figure 24:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Closed: the proxy counts the number of unsuccessful requests, then after reaching some threshold, it changes the state to Open and puts timeout after what changes the state to Half-open. In this state, all requests are redirected to the operation server.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Open: catches all the requests and returns fail immediately<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Half-open: passes a limited number of requests to the server and waits for a response. If any operation fails, revert the system to an Open state. If the operation never failed till reaching the threshold, assume that the problem causing errors is fixed and change the state to Closed.
