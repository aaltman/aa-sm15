Read-Write Quorum Systems<BR>We now discuss the relationship between existing algorithms for linearizable reads and read-write quorum systems. We do so with the aid of the illustration in Figure 1. A read-write quorum system is defined by a set of read quorums and write quorums such that every read and write quorum intersects. In the context of specialized algorithms for linearizable reads, each read and write quorum is a subset of the ?? processes in the system. In leader reads, the only read quorum is the leader and any simple majority of processes including the leader is a write quorum. Since at most one process is the leader at any time, every read and write quorum intersects. In majority quorum reads, read and write quorums are any simple majority of processes. Similarly, since any two simple majorities intersect so does every read and write quorum. Flexible quorum reads define the quorum system explicitly. Finally, in local reads, every process is a read quorum and there is a single write quorum containing all processes. Consequently, all existing algorithms for linearizable reads reduce to specific read-write quorum systems.
