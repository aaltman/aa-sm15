To provide the real-time ordering guarantee of linearizability, SMR algorithms often rely on a distinguished process known as the leader to sequence write operations. The leader does so in two phases: prepare and commit. The prepare phase consists of the leader proposing that a write operation ?? be assigned to the ??-th location in the log. The prepare phase completes once a majority of processes accept this proposal ensuring it is decided. After this, ?? can be committed, that is, a process can apply ?? to their replica after they apply all write operations assigned up to index ??.<BR></P>
<P>Read operations are processed by assigning them to the index number of either the latest committed write operation or some concurrent write operation. Once a read operation has been assigned to some index number ??, it is completed by executing it against some replica that has applied all write operations with index numbers up to and including ??.
