Retry Storm Antipattern<BR>Retry Storm antipattern is well described in Microsoft [5] documentation. The retry storm antipattern is a kind of failure described previously in this paper and the primary purpose of the research. In this document, they describe the metastable failure caused by a retry storm and some assumptions on how to prevent it. They suggested not using a self-made retry policy but ready ones, checking Circuit Breaker patterns, adding something to shut down the system, delays between retries, and much more. They also described how to detect such kinds of errors using telemetry tools. Additionally, to avoid this behavior they propose using the randomization of retries, in general it is just simply adding some random number of milliseconds to the wait time so there are no cases when too many requests are performed at the same time.
