<b> : </b>Motivation</H2>The reason Paxos is popular is due to its excellent fault-tolerance properties. Paxos (and Paxos flavors) preserve safety to the face of fully-asynchronous environment, any sequence of faults, and even to the face of network partitions. Paxos and its derivatives are often used for replication in strongly-consistent databases, e.g., CockroachDB, Spanner, YugaByte, PaxosStore. As such, performance of Paxos protocols become important for the performance of distributed databases/systems. However, Paxos variants have widely different performance inherently, and even for the same protocol, different workload, topology, and network conditions result into widely varying performance.<BR><BR>In this work, we study the performance of Paxos protocols. We take a two-pronged approach, and provide both analytic and empirical evaluations which corroborate and complement each other. We then distill these results to give back-of-the-envelope formulas for estimating the throughput scalability of different Paxos protocols.
