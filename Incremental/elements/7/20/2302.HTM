We want our WAL and recovery protocols to support a Steal and No-Force policy for the buffer pool, in order not to throttle the performance while we ensure durability. Given the Steal and No-Force constraints, ARIES goes the extra mile: It tries to get the WAL flushing to be almost async, to avoid any stalls from the WAL flushing as well. Of course for correctness, there needs to be&nbsp; tiny bit of dependency/synchronization in flushing of the WAL. We will discuss this next under Principle 1.
