We conceptualize risk as a continuum. We give equal importance to figuring out how to engineer greater reliability into Google systems and identifying the appropriate level of tolerance for the services we run. Doing so allows us to perform a cost/benefit analysis to determine, for example, where on the (nonlinear) risk continuum we should place Search, Ads, Gmail, or Photos. Our goal is to explicitly align the risk taken by a given service with the risk the business is willing to bear. We strive to make a service reliable enough, but no<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">more</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>reliable than it needs to be.
