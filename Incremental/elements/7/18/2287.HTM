<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">experience shows that as we build systems, cost does not increase linearly as reliability increments&#8212;an incremental improvement in reliability may cost 100x more than the previous increment. The costliness has two dimensions:</P>

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">The cost associated with redundant equipment that, for example, allows us to take systems offline for routine or unforeseen maintenance, or provides space for us to store parity code blocks that provide a minimum data durability guarantee.

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">The cost borne by an organization when it allocates engineering resources to build systems or features that diminish risk instead of features that are directly visible to or usable by end users. These engineers no longer work on new features and products for end users.</DD></DL>
