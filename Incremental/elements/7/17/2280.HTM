To comply with the strict two-phase locking (S2PL) protocol, a transaction needs to comply with 2PL, and release its<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>write (exclusive)</I><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>locks only after the transaction has ended (i.e., either<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>committed</I><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>or<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>aborted</I>). On the other hand,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>read (shared)</I><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>locks are released regularly during the shrinking phase.
