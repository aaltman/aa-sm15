<b> : </b>Introduction</H2>We believe the main reason for the success of low-level virtual machines was that in the early days of cloud computing users wanted to recreate the same computing environment in the cloud that they had on their local computers to simplify porting their workloads to the cloud.<BR><BR>To set up your own environment in cloud (using virtual machines), you need to address these 8 issues.<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Redundancy for availability, so that a single machine failure doesn't take down the service.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>Geographic distribution of redundant copies to preserve the service in case of disaster.</LI>
<LI>Load balancing and request routing to efficiently utilize resources.</LI>
<LI>Autoscaling in response to changes in load to scale up or down the system.</LI>
<LI>Monitoring to make sure the service is still running well.</LI>
<LI>Logging to record messages needed for debugging or performance tuning.&nbsp;</LI>
<LI>System upgrades, including security patching.</LI>
<LI>Migration to new instances as they become available.</LI></OL><BR>Compared to what it takes to set up the servers with the proper environment to run the code, the code to accomplish application logic might be dozens of lines of JavaScript.<BR><BR><B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">In our definition, for a service to be considered serverless, it must scale automatically with no need for explicit provisioning, and be billed based on usage.</B>&nbsp;Cloud functions are the general purpose element in serverless computing today, and lead the way to a simplified and general purpose programming model for the cloud.<BR><BR><B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">While we are unsure which solutions will win, we believe all issues will all be addressed eventually, thereby enabling serverless computing to become the face of cloud computing.</B>
