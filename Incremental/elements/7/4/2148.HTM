What could be the reasons this claim may not hold?<BR><BR>First of all, we need to quantify and limit the claim. What does skyrocket mean? What does it mean for serverless to become the face of cloud computing? And finally what does serverless mean? Is this claim true of today's cloud functions? If we don't have a stable definition of serverless, this claim is prone to the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(33,150,243)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">No True Scotsman fallacy</A>. If serverless use does not skyrocket, it will be because we don't have "true" serverless yet.<BR><BR>Ok, assuming that the claim is quantified, what may be some reasons it could fail?<BR><BR>Serverless improves greatly on ease of use, and that alone may warrant a lot of use for serverless. But ease-of-use is not necessarily exclusive to serverless. BaaS managed services, like distributed databases, can get even easier to use. And<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(33,150,243)" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs">some even support stored procedures</A>, which helps meet some of the serverless needs.<BR><BR>When comparing with PaaS, the paper said that serverless differentiates itself due to its very quick autoscaling. But, this may not be such a strong differentiator for the customers. Most customers may not have very bursty&nbsp; workloads that require quick and extreme scaling.<BR><BR>Another contender for the serverless lunch may be software as a service (SaaS), like instagram, icloud, etc. SaaS can be even simpler to use than serverless, and may be programmed with visual workflows using mouse clicks. SaaS may steal users from serverless would work if SaaS services play well with each other so customers can pipe output from one as input to others.<BR><BR><B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>2. Could serverless ever work for stateful services?</I></B><BR>It is easy to make FaaS serverless because it is stateless. But FaaS scalability is limited by the BaaS scalability it depends on. It is easy to scale storage, because it is also stateless. But, the story becomes murkier when it comes to scalability of stateful services. At the limits, this is likely to be impossible: You can't have extreme scalability and extreme state (requiring incessant coordination). But outside the extremes, with good engineering we can get quick scalability for stateful services.<BR><BR><B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><I>3.
