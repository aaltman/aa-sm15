<b> : </b>Summary and predictions</H2>By providing a simplified programming environment, serverless computing makes the cloud much easier to use, thereby attracting more people who can and will use it. [This is] a maturation akin to the move from assembly language to high-level languages more than four decades ago.<BR><BR><B style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">We predict that serverless use will skyrocket.</B><BR><BR>The first step is Serverless Ephemeral Storage, which must provide low latency and high IOPS at reasonable cost, but need not provide economical long term storage. A second class of applications would benefit from Serverless Durable Storage, which does demand long term storage. New non-volatile memory technologies may help with such storage systems. Other applications would benefit from a low latency signaling service and support for popular communication primitives.<BR><BR>Two challenges for the future of serverless computing are improved security and accommodating cost-performance advances that are likely to come from special purpose processors.<BR><BR>The future of serverful computing will be to facilitate BaaS. Applications that prove to be difficult to write on top of serverless computing, such as OLTP databases or communication primitives such as queues, will likely be offered as part of a richer set of services from all cloud providers.
