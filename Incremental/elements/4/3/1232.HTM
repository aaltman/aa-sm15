They allow app creators and web designers to quickly outline their wireframe designs, helping them visualize how things work from a top-level perspective. These diagrams act as a blueprint, so they don&#8217;t include great levels of detail. If you want to create a diagram with more detail, consider using a high-fidelity wireframe. A high-fidelity wireframe is a complete visual representation of a framework. It has more technical detail and is usually clickable and responsive to user actions. This gives designers a feel for how the final design will work for real users, making it helpful for user testing. Typically speaking, a low-fi wireframe is the first step in the design process. Designers move to a high-fi wireframe when this is signed off to flesh out the details.
