<b> : </b>5. Wait-Free</H4>The Wait-Free property guarantees that any given thread provided with a time-slice will be able to make some progress and eventually complete. It guarantees that the number of steps is finite, but in practice it may be extremely large and depend on the number of active threads, which is why there aren't many practical Wait-Free data structures.<BR><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: "Courier New", Courier, monospace'>Definition</SPAN>: A method is Wait-Free if it guarantees that every call finishes its execution in a finite number of steps.<BR><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: "Courier New", Courier, monospace'>Example</SPAN>: This paper has an example of an algorithm that is Wait-Free (unbounded)<BR>"<A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(34,136,187)" href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~moran/r/PS/bm94.ps"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Wait-Freedom vs. Bounded Wait-Freedom in Public Data Structures</SPAN></A>"
