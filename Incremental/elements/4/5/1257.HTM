Blocking<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Starvation-Free</SPAN><BR></FONT><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Obstruction-Free</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Obstruction-Free<BR><B>Lock-Free</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Lock-Free (LF)<BR><B>Wait-Free</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Wait-Free (WF)&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Wait-Free Bounded (WFB)</SPAN><BR><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Wait-Free Population Oblivious (WFPO)</SPAN></SPAN><BR><BR><BR>Before we dive into the definition of each of these terms, let us look at some of the details behind them.<BR><BR>From what's written on section 3.6 of "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming", it is difficult to understand whether or not the definitions for Wait-Free Bounded and Wait-Free Population Oblivious are orthogonal or not. Personally, I think that having an algorithm that is Wait-Free Population-Oblivious implies that it is bounded and, therefore, it is also Wait-Free Bounded. This means that a function (or algorithm, or class) can be WF, or WFB, or WFPO, this last one being the "<I>best</I>" of all the Progress Conditions.<BR><BR>The examples we will give here are all concerning the progress condition of a particular function (of an algorithm, or class), and not the full algorithm. We do this because different functions in a given algorithm may have very different progress guarantees, like for example: the Write operations may be Blocking, while the Read operations be Wait-Free Population Oblivious, something that is not obvious when you first look at Lock-Free and Wait-Free data structures.<BR><BR>Yes, you read it correctly: a data structure may have some of its functions Blocking and others Lock-Free and others even Wait-Free. On the other hand, when we say that a particular data structure is Lock-Free it means that<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>all<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>its operations are Lock-Free, or better.<BR>There is no standard strict ranking in the literature of which one is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>better</I>, but it is usually implied as :<BR><SPAN style='FONT-FAMILY: "Courier New", Courier, monospace'>Wait-Free is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>better<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>than Lock-Free which is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I>better<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>than Blocking.</SPAN><BR><BR>The reason for this is that, there aren't that many (practical) data structures that are Lock-Free or Wait-Free, so the issue of properly classifying them doesn't usually show up. Andreia and I have come up with so many different variations of different concurrent algorithms with mixed Progress Conditions that we had to start naming them properly and "sorting" them, to keep a handle on it, and to figure out which ones were worth researching.<BR>Our order is the one described in the beginning of the post, where item<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Blocking</SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is the worst, and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. WFPO</SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is the best possible kind of guarantee you can get.<BR><BR>Something else that is a common cause of confusion is that "Wait-Free implies Lock-Free" (but not the other way around). This means that a function that is said to be Wait-Free gives that same (and more) progress guarantees than a function that is Lock-Free.<BR>Here is a Venn diagram that might explain better what we mean by it:<BR><BR><BR></FONT>
