What is at the root of this phenomenon? Cultural expectations reinforced what financial conditions necessitated: that women pursue careers only to the degree that their primary role as mother, wife, and housewife allowed. Having been forced to subordinate their work to their role as mothers, women often had jobs for which they were overqualified and which offered them little satisfaction and little money.</P>

It is still widespread (for both men and women) to collect unemploy- ment benefits from their &#8220;official&#8221; job while moonlighting at a job in the &#8220;second economy.&#8221; Unfortunately, the alternative of career advancement and full utilization of powers does not always appeal to professional women.</P></LI>
