Cultural patterns of feminine behavior (reinforced again by financial necessities) still seem to cultivate dependency on the male partner as well as withdrawal into the home. Both mentali- ties speak of weak individualistic goals and civic values.</P>

When asked, an overwhelming majority of women articulated their inertia by opting to keeping the mandatory age &#8212; fifty-five &#8212; introduced by the communists. Communism created atomized societies, and atomization for women was even more acute than for men, with the family being their sole priority. The mentality of double dependency seems to counteract any horizontal ties of solidarity. Women today are less willing or able to participate in civic activities than are men; driven by a false sense of duty, women feel they cannot follow such pursuits from which &#8220;only&#8221; they would benefit per- sonally. Hence, there is among women a general lack of interest</P>

Very few attempts have been made to reverse this state of passivity and inertia.</P>

Women in Eastern Europe, often viewing life as a series of natural catastrophes to be accepted as they come, seem to have given up without even attempting to bring about real change in their lives. Communist and patriarchal societies bred men and women of a subservient attitude, who were no threat to the respective controlling powers. However, with the political and economic changes, it has become clear that survival itself depends on how individuals can rid themselves of these old mentalities.</P></LI>
