<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Thirty years ago, a wave of optimism swept across Europe as walls and regimes fell, and long-oppressed publics embraced open societies, open markets and a more united Europe. Three decades later, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that few people in the former Eastern Bloc regret the monumental changes of 1989-1991. Yet, neither are they entirely content with their current political or economic circumstances. Indeed, like their Western European counterparts, substantial shares of Central and Eastern European citizens worry about the future on issues like inequality and the functioning of their political systems.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image aligncenter" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; TEXT-ALIGN: center; CLEAR: none; MARGIN: 0px auto 1em; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values-00-014/" rel="attachment wp-att-44571"><IMG class="not-transparent wp-image-44571" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #b8c3cf" alt="Most in former Eastern Bloc approve of shift to multiparty and free market systems " src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-00-014.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="center" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="false" data-dominant-color="b8c3cf"></A></FIGURE>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Those in Central and Eastern European nations that joined the European Union generally believe membership has been good for their countries, and there is widespread support in the region for many democratic values. Still, even though most broadly embrace democracy, the intensity of people&#8217;s commitment to specific democratic principles is not always strong.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">When asked about the shifts to multiparty democracy and a market economy that occurred following the collapse of communism, former Eastern Bloc publics surveyed largely approve of these changes. For instance, 85% of Poles support the shifts to both democracy and capitalism. However, support is not uniform &#8211; more than a third of Bulgarians and Ukrainians disapprove, as do roughly half in Russia.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">These questions about democracy and a market economy were<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/1991/09/17/1991-pulse-of-europe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>first asked in 1991</A>, and then again in 2009. In a few nations &#8211; Hungary, Lithuania and Ukraine &#8211; support for both declined between 1991 and 2009 before bouncing back significantly over the past decade.

<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">The varying levels of enthusiasm for democracy and free markets may be driven in part by different perspectives about the degree to which societies have made progress over the past three decades. Most Poles, Czechs and Lithuanians, and more than four-in-ten Hungarians and Slovaks, believe the economic situation for most people in their country today is better than it was under communism. And in these five nations, people are more likely to hold this view now than was the case in 2009, when Europe was struggling with the effects of the global financial crisis.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">However, in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria, more than half currently say things are worse for most people now than during the communist era.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">When asked whether their countries have made progress over the past three decades across a range of issues, the Central and Eastern European publics surveyed feel most positive about issues like education and living standards. But opinions are more divided about progress on law and order and family values, and most say the changes have had a negative impact on health care.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">There is widespread agreement that elites have gained more from the enormous changes of the past 30 years than average citizens have. Large majorities in all Central and Eastern European nations polled think politicians and business leaders have benefited, but fewer say this about ordinary people.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Just as there are different views about the progress nations have made in the recent past, opinions differ about the future as well. Across the former communist nations included in the survey, people are relatively optimistic about the future of their country&#8217;s relations with other European nations, but mostly pessimistic about the functioning of the political system and specific economic issues like jobs and inequality.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image alignright" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1em; MAX-WIDTH: 420px !important; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px; margin-inline: 2em 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values-00-012/" rel="attachment wp-att-44569"><IMG class="not-transparent wp-image-44569" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #aebcdb" alt="Homosexuality more accepted in Western Europe" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-00-012.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="right" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="false" data-dominant-color="aebcdb"></A></FIGURE>

<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">There is also a divide on views about the economic future. Regarding the economic prospects for the next generation, hope is somewhat more common in former Eastern Bloc nations.

<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">EU member states are mostly united in their support for the broad European project. The EU gets largely favorable ratings, most say membership has been good for their countries, and most believe their countries have benefited economically from being a part of the EU, although positive reviews for the institution are hardly universal. The most favorable ratings for the EU are found in former communist nations Poland and Lithuania, both of which became member states in 2004.</P>

They are less approving of the shifts to democracy and capitalism, less supportive of specific democratic principles and less satisfied with their lives.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">These are among the key findings from a new Pew Research Center survey of 17 countries, including 14 EU nations, Russia, Ukraine and the United States. The survey covers a broad array of topics, including views about the transition to multiparty politics and free markets, democratic values, the EU, Germany, political leaders, life satisfaction, economic conditions, gender equality, minority groups and political parties.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">The survey was conducted among 18,979 people from May 13 to Aug. 12, 2019. This study builds upon two previous surveys by Pew Research Center and its predecessor. The first was conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press (a forerunner of Pew Research Center) from April 15 to May 31, 1991. The second was a poll conducted by Pew Research Center from Aug. 27 through Sept. 24, 2009, just prior to the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</P>

Even though Czechoslovakia was a single country in 1991, we show 1991 results for geographic areas that correspond to the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 1991, Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine were surveyed as republics of the Soviet Union.
