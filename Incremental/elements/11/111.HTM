Women were not only victims of communism&#8217;s totalitarian grip, but also of the patriarchal traditions so wide- spread in other parts of Europe, especially the Slavic countries. In prewar Hungary, paternalistic and authoritarian attitudes toward women were reinforced by the anachronistic social atmosphere of the Horthy regime. The legacy of limited choices, traditional feminine ideals, a secondary role for women, and a general insensitivity to women&#8217;s issues was, to a certain degree, shared by both Western and Eastern Europe until the social necessities created by the war and, later, the women&#8217;s move- ment of the 1960s, brought about fundamental changes. In the</P>

Prewar mentalities survived in a peculiar communist distortion. Observers, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, often misappre- hended the role women played in Hungary. Visitors could eas- ily get the impression that women were very &#8220;Western&#8221; in Budapest: they dressed well, were educated, and led a semi- Western lifestyle. What was not visible to short-term tourists, however, was how much time, money, and energy had to be spent in keeping up this seemingly Western &#8212; but still immensely modest &#8212; lifestyle. Because they lived in a commu- nist country with patriarchal roots, they suffered a double dependency, their lives controlled politically by the state and their genders controlled by a male-dominated society. It was a &#8220;double burden&#8221; of a special kind because their ambitions were thwarted not only by the totalitarian atmosphere but also by the patriarchal mentality. No wonder, then, that it is more difficult</P>

The vari- ous benefits women enjoyed in the communist societies &#8212; such as full employment, free health care, maternity leave, and inex- pensive abortions &#8212; only sound appealing to foreign observers, to whom these words have different and much more positive meanings. In Hungarian &#8212; as well as Czech, Slovak, Polish, or Russian &#8212; these words sound pitiful, cheap, poor, and gloomy, because that is the reality they evoke. When, in Hungary, we hear about free health care, we do not imagine an American hos- pital but rather an overcrowded, understaffed, underequipped, and underdeveloped East European hospital where doctors and nurses must be &#8220;tipped&#8221; for their services. When we hear about maternity leave, we know how little it pays and how the prac- tice generates underachievement. These communist accomplish- ments have proved to be myths &#8212; the myth of full employment put women in underachieving jobs and the myth of free health care left them with rapidly deteriorating bodies and a complete lack of health awareness.</P>
