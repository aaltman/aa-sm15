Emotionally, they evoke scenes of &#8220;betrayal&#8221;: Versailles, Munich, and Yalta. Poles and Hungarians refer to John F. Kennedy&#8217;s speech of 1957 in the U.S. Senate, empathizing with the frustration of the Poles and Hun- garians upon hearing that &#8220;the United States had never meant the obvious implications of its liberation policy.&#8221; Hungarians will remember the disappointment of Prime Minister Antall, who, in early 1990, was continuously cautioned by the various leading politicians of the West to go slow. It was a sobering antagonism: the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe were committed to dismantling communism, yet signals of encour- agement were lagging behind. But the disappointment of Cen- tral Europeans in the West culminated after the euphoria of 1989 &#8211; 90 was over. This is the time labeled by Tsvetan Todorov, the Bulgarian-born structuralist, as &#8220;post-totalitarian depres- sion,&#8221; a feeling of letdown experienced by Central and East Europeans after realizing that the West was not supporting them as enthusiastically as they had hoped.</P>

The democratic community in the West was unprepared for the collapse of com- munism; they were prepared only for war and confrontation. The West did not think it necessary to prepare in any other way, since it looked utterly improbable that this colossal empire might collapse by itself. Nor was this collapse necessarily awaited. For many in the West, it looked &#8212; and perhaps still looks &#8212; much more comfortable to have Eastern Europe con- tained and by itself. The political systems in Hungary&#8212;and, to a lesser degree, in most other Central and East European coun- tries &#8212; were, by this time, already quite far from Stalinism. Hun- garian communism had a &#8220;human face&#8221;: it was not aggressive, growing less and less proud of its accomplishments, and humil- iating the individual less and less frequently. Besides, this self- disciplined authoritarian system controlled itself: the Western world was not threatened by having to admit refugees and guest workers or by local conflicts awaiting solution. Because the communist countries closed the fences on themselves, they did not challenge the conscience of the West either.</P>

There was a comfort in not having to deal with the coun- tries individually, only as a block. The complexity today is per- plexing. I am always reminded of what Emperor Joseph II, in Milos Forman&#8217;s film<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">Amadeus</I>, says of Mozart&#8217;s music: &#8220;Too many notes.&#8221;</P>

As a European intel- lectual, Havel is justly concerned for what he calls moral and metaphysical values such as &#8220;democracy, respect for human rights and for the order of nature, the freedom of the individual and the inviolability of his property, the feeling of co-responsi- bility for the world.&#8221; Havel accuses the West of seeing only its immediate interests. For what is at stake in Central and Eastern Europe has a direct bearing on the West &#8212; the destiny of tradi- tional values and the principles of Western civilization.
