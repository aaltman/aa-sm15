<b> : </b>Most Europeans support democratic values, but many worry about how democracy is working</H3>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Across all 14 EU countries included in the study, as well Russia, Ukraine and the United States, there is broad support for specific democratic rights and institutions. Respondents were presented with nine different features of liberal democracy, then asked how important it is to have each one in their country. Majorities in every nation polled said all of these nine factors are at least<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">somewhat&nbsp;</EM>important, and in most countries, large majorities expressed this view.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">However, attitudes differ regarding whether these principles are<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">very<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM>important. Large majorities typically consider having a fair judicial system and gender equality very important, but support for religious freedom and allowing civil society groups to operate freely is in some cases less enthusiastic.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image aligncenter" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; TEXT-ALIGN: center; CLEAR: none; MARGIN: 0px auto 1em; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values-00-09/" rel="attachment wp-att-44566"><IMG class="has-transparency wp-image-44566" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #e0e1e0" alt="Judicial fairness, gender equality seen as very important priorities across Europe " src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-00-09.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="center" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="true" data-dominant-color="e0e1e0"></A></FIGURE>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">And there are notable differences across countries. Western Europeans are generally more likely than Central and Eastern Europeans to rate these rights and institutions as very important. Russians consistently express the lowest levels of support. Americans, meanwhile, are often especially likely to consider these principles very important.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">This is consistent with other<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/10/16/globally-broad-support-for-representative-and-direct-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Pew Research Center surveys</A>, which have found that while democracy is a popular idea around the world, the intensity of people&#8217;s commitment to it is not always strong. For instance, representative democracy is widely embraced, but significant shares of the public in many nations are open to nondemocratic forms of government as well. People support free expression, but there are strong differences across nations regarding the appropriate boundaries of permissible speech. And, as the current survey shows, fundamental democratic rights and institutions are widely embraced, but some give those principles a less than full-throated endorsement.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">There are also large cross-national differences on how people view the current state of democracy in their country. In Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany, 65% or more are satisfied with the way democracy is working, while in Greece, Bulgaria, the UK, Italy and Spain two-thirds or more are dissatisfied.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image alignright" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1em; MAX-WIDTH: 420px !important; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; FLOAT: right; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px; margin-inline: 2em 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values-00-08/" rel="attachment wp-att-44565"><IMG class="not-transparent wp-image-44565" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #c9cbcf" alt="Few believe elected officials care what they think" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-00-08.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="right" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="false" data-dominant-color="c9cbcf"></A></FIGURE>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">One factor<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: " href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/29/global-views-democracy-appendix-a-factors-that-influence-democratic-dissatisfaction/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>driving dissatisfaction</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>with the way democracy is working is frustration with political elites, who are often perceived as out of touch with average citizens. Across the EU nations polled, a median of 69% disagree with the statement &#8220;Most elected officials care about what people like me think.&#8221; Majorities also share this perspective in Russia, Ukraine and the U.S.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">In former Eastern Bloc nations, there is a widespread perception that politicians &#8211; and to a somewhat lesser extent, business people &#8211; have benefited greatly from the changes that have taken place since the end of the communist era. The belief that ordinary people have benefited is much less common, although the share of the public expressing this view has increased in many countries since 2009.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Another sign of frustration with political elites and institutions is the poor ratings for most European political parties. The survey asked respondents whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of major parties in their country. In total, we asked about 59 parties across the 14 EU nations surveyed &#8211; but only six of these parties receive a favorable rating from half or more of the public.</P>

In every nation surveyed, roughly half or more agree with the statement &#8220;Voting gives people like me some say about how the government runs things.&#8221; And about seven-in-ten or more express this view in Spain, Sweden, Slovakia, Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Poland, as well as in the U.S.
