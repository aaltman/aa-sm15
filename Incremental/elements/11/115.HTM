Scientists, scholars, writ- ers, and academics were supposed to depend on the state just as did other individuals. Many accepted this bargain and became dependent upon the state&#8217;s cultural patronage.</P>

In spite of the supposed open-mindedness of the Hungarian communists, the cultural commissars maintained a firm grip on what people could read, write, say, and think. My own personal experience was that this grip had hardly eased even by the 1980s. Upon returning from a trip to New York, my copies of books by Solzhenitsyn, Churchill, and Betty Friedan were equally confiscated. Book- stores and libraries, even the best academic university libraries, also carried only those books permitted and tolerated by the cul- tural commissars. Naturally, only these commissars could give the green light to what books were to be translated and pub- lished by the state-owned publishing houses, which were intri- cately overseen by censors of many kinds.</P>

Hungary&#8217;s professional classes then demanded, as well as guaranteed, that the major intellectual events of Europe and America find their way to Hungarian readers. A typical example is Tocqueville&#8217;s<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">Democracy in Amer- ica</I>, which first appeared in French in 1835 in Paris, three years after that in English in New York, and another three years later, in 1841, in Hungarian in Pest. Or, at a time when German was commonly spoken by the educated classes of Hungary, Freud and Jung were immediately translated for the general public in the first decades of the century. The few democratic years after World War II saw a boom in publication of translations as well; people were starved to read what they were not permitted dur- ing the war, so Walter Lippmann, Wendell Willkie, Andr&#233; Mau- rois, George Marshall, Stephen Vincent Ben&#233;t, and Henry Steele Commager were immediately translated. This intellectual &#8220;gusto&#8221; is especially striking if one considers the starvation&#8212;or, at best, &#8220;diet&#8221; &#8212; that was to come again in the next several decades. Following the communist takeover of 1948, Hungary lost its tradition of keeping its book market up-to-date with European and other readings. The generations that grew up between 1948 and the mid- to late 1980s found themselves sealed off from most of the intellectual currents of Europe and the United States.</P>

Of the psychologists, Sigmund Freud reap- peared only in the 1980s (at least in part); Carl Gustav Jung, Erik Erikson, and Abraham H. Maslow appeared not at all; and, especially painful is that such Hungarian-born giants as S&#225;ndor Ferenczi, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, and K&#225;roly Ker&#233;nyi could hardly be read in Hungarian. Ferdinand de Saussure had to wait</P>

Martin Buber and Elie Wiesel were too Jewish to appear at all; Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Karl Rahner were probably too Catholic.

Literary censorship never allowed Ezra Pound to be translated in a separate volume.</P>

There were too many missing links with the international intellectual community. Thawing began in the late 1980s, but only after the decisive changes of 1990 did state censorship com- pletely disappear. Today everything can appear &#8212; and every- thing does, indeed. The publishing industry is booming; the only difficulty (apart from the high prices) is finding a book of artistic or intellectual value among the flood of paperback best- sellers and cookbooks.</P>

Other kinds of cultural catching up will take much longer. During the forty to forty-five years of communism, the infra- structure of cultural knowledge was set back. Thus, the primary tools of intellectual work are missing: encyclopedias, word find- ers, thesauruses, dictionaries (except for foreign languages).

It petrified certain spheres of life and prevented the emergence of free enterprise, free spirit, and creativity. This is the Orwellian meaning of the slogan under which Hungarians grew up: &#8220;Work in socialism is a free and creative enterprise.&#8221;</P></LI>
