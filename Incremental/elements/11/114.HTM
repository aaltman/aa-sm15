This was so in spite of the social and economic conditions, which were most often less developed than in the Western part of Europe. Even, for example, during the darker times of Turkish or Austrian occupation, the intellectual output was not proportionately poorer than in independent countries with flourishing economies.</P>

In the fifteenth century, the Renais- sance court of Hungary&#8217;s King Matthias attracted the most out- standing European artists and poets; the reformation of Calvin and Luther gained a following among the Hungarian theolo- gians and laymen of Transylvania, the independent province. There were outstanding periods when the cultural climate of Hungary was thoroughly European &#8212; otherwise, Haydn would not have been in the employ of the Esterh&#225;zys, nor would Gus- tav Mahler have been the director of the Budapest Opera.</P>

The general pride that Hun- gary has produced more Nobel laureates per capita than any other country is perhaps the most telling. The truth is that all Hungarian Nobel Prize winners left the country at some point, and just about all of them received the prize for work they did</P>

Of course, these scientists are still a great asset to their mother country, and their high number speaks to the quality of Hungarian education, especially in the sciences. Unfortunately, today it is not clear whether these stan- dards can be maintained. Among the myths of Hungarian intel- lectualism, the one about the high quality of Hungarian literature is a good case in point. The myth, laced with a dash of self-pity, says: &#8220;Had Hungarian writers written in a language other than Hungarian, the world would have known<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">our<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>Shake- speares and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">our<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>Mark Twains as well.&#8221;</P>

The world of the mind was considered the gravest threat to the communists, one to be controlled by all means. Among such conditions, writing performed a distorted function: to say indi- rectly that which could not be said directly. Literature, as well as scholarship, became politicized; in a sense, this function made literature less &#8220;literary.&#8221; The good writer was expected to be the &#8220;conscience&#8221; of the nation, a person of moral courage.
