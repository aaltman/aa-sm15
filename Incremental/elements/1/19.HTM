Although RCU is actually quite simple once you understand it, getting there can sometimes be a challenge. Part of the problem is that most of the past descriptions of RCU have been written with the mistaken assumption that there is "one true way" to describe RCU. Instead, the experience has been that different people must take different paths to arrive at an understanding of RCU. This document provides several different paths, as follows:</SPAN>

People who prefer to start with an API that they can then experiment with should focus on Section 2. People who prefer to start with example uses should focus on Sections 3 and 4. People who need to understand the RCU implementation should focus on Section 5, then dive into the kernel source code. People who reason best by analogy should focus on Section 6. Section 7 serves as an index to the docbook API documentation, and Section 8 is the traditional answer key.</SPAN>

If you need to know everything about everything, feel free to read the whole thing -- but if you are really that type of person, you have perused the source code and will therefore never need this document anyway. ;-)
