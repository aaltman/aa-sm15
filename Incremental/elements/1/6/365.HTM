<b> : </b>Provide<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A name=sources>sources</A></H4>
<P>Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>2+2=4</EM>), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Watch out!, Other sources differ!</EM>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).</P></LI>
