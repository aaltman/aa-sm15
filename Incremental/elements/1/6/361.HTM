<P>One of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life. In the example below you will save time if you use a personal reference rather than trying to paint a picture that would aptly illustrate the question</P>
<TABLE cellPadding=10 align=center bgColor=#c0c0c0 border=2>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TH bgColor=#ff0000>Harder item</TH></TR>

<P>Q: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back?<BR>A: divan</P></TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Q: What is the name of a soft bed without arms or back? (like the one at Robert's parents)<BR>A: divan</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>If you remember exactly what kind of soft bed can be found in Robert's parents' apartment you will save time by not having to dig exactly into the semantics of the definition and/or looking for an appropriate graphic illustration for the piece of furniture in question.
