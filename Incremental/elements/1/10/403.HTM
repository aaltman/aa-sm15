While dozens of concept maps might be still active in your brain following the last dream in your last REM-rich stage of sleep, your attention is still not there. You may have some vestigial capacity to introduce a bit of thinking at that "waking" stage. Your brain is in the process of setting up the focus map that begins your conscious thinking process. Ideally, the waking moment is like a light switch in which you move fast from sleep to a fully conscious mind. In reality though, this may take a while. The brain can actually capture and lose focus, while still remaining in an unstable state between sleep and waking. You can then use those first glimpses of clarity to capture concept maps still active in the wake of nighttime<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Memory optimization in sleep" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep">memory optimization</A>. The moment when your focus map lights up clearly with waking might be the most likely time for a breakthrough idea. There is also a period of increased creativity following that moment. When great discoverers speak of inventing things in sleep or upon waking, they rarely make it specific, and possibly they do not even know if the lightbulb turned on with the first captured focus map, or perhaps only in the minutes that follow. In the end, it won't matter as long as you consciously protect that period from external disruption.</P>

The morning is the time of maximum protection. If you begin the day by turning on the news, you already miss out on your problem solving capacity.

The morning routine and all problem solving that follows, should all be run in protected mental mode away from all distractions.
