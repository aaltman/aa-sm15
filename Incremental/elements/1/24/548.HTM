<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.4em; hyphens: auto">ioctl() is the most common way for applications to interface with device drivers. It is flexible and easily extended by adding new commands and can be passed through character devices, block devices as well as sockets and other special file descriptors.</P>
