Humans with fast access to extra RAM memory would not be much smarter than ordinary men with access to Google. Speed is secondary to reasoning. The alleged obstacle towards the big memory nirvana is the interface between the electronic and wet memory. In reality, the difficulty of the extension is in the implementation of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Conceptual computation" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; COLOR: rgb(6,69,173); overflow-wrap: break-word" href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptual_computation">conceptual computation</A>. Once we have intelligent concept networks in operation, we do not need human-machine interface. A human can simply ask a concept network to receive intelligent answers. It does not matter if reasoning occurs inside the brain or inside a machine. The answers are all we care. Today, we cannot delegate our memory to Google because human brains are the only efficient concept networks we know. All conceptual computation must occur inside the brain.</P></B>
