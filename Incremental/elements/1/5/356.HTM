<P>A<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set">set</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is a collection of objects. For example, a set of fruits might be an apple, a pear and a peach. A classic example of an item that is difficult to learn is an item that asks for the list of the members of a set. For example:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>What countries belong to the European Union?</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them into<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations">enumerations</A>. Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum%20information%20principle">minimum information principle</A>:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</STRONG>. In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For that reason:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Avoid sets!</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>If you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations">techniques for dealing with enumerations</A></P>

<P>Note that in the example above, we converted a 15-member set into 9 items, five of which are 2-3 member sets, and one is a six member enumeration. Put it to your SuperMemo, and see how easy it is to generate the list of the European Union members using the historic timeline! Note the tricks used with France and the UK. They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process. Note also that the sum of information included in this well-formulated approach is far greater than that of the original set. Thus along simplicity, we gained some useful knowledge. All individual items effectively comply with the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum%20information%20principle">minimum information principle</A>! You could go further by trying to split the Germany-Italy-Benelux set or using mnemonic techniques to memorize the final seven-member enumeration (i.e. the last of the questions above). However, you should take those steps only if you have any problems with retaining the proposed set in memory.</P></LI>
