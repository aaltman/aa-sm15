<b> : </b><A name=Enumerations>Avoid enumerations</A></H4>
<P>Enumerations are also an example of classic items that are hard to learn. They are still far more acceptable than sets. Avoid enumerations wherever you can. If you cannot avoid them, deal with them using<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Cloze%20deletion">cloze deletions</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(overlapping cloze deletions if possible). Learning the alphabet can be a good example of an overlapping cloze deletion:</P>

<P>Q: Fill out the missing letters of the alphabet C ... ... ... G<BR>A: D, E, F</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The above items will make learning the alphabet much faster. The greatest advantage of the above approach is that is it easier for psychological reasons: the student does not have to stop repetitions to recite the whole sequence and can only focus on a small part of the learned material. Still it is recommended that he recite the whole alphabet<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>after</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>making the repetition. However, once all individual pieces are well remembered, reciting the whole should be a pleasant and speedy action that produces little frustration.<BR>The cloze deletion used above is an overlapping cloze deletion, i.e. the same parts of the enumeration are strengthened in memory using different items (for example, the sequence C-D will be needed to recall the second and the third item). This redundancy does not contradict the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum%20information%20principle">minimum information principle</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>because<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>the extra information is added in extra items</STRONG>.</P>
<P>You can also deal with enumerations by using grouping like in the case of sets (see the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#EEC">European Union example</A>) but cloze deletions should be simpler and should suffice in most cases.<BR>Learning poems is an example of learning enumerations (all words and sentences have to be uttered in a predefined sequence); however, due to strong semantic connections, the rhyme and the rhythm, it may often be possible to effectively remember poems without using cloze deletion and without the frustration of forgetting small subcomponents again and again. However, once you notice you stumble with your poem, you should dismember it using cloze deletion and thus make sure that the learning is fast, easy, effective and pleasurable</P>

<P>Does it all sound artificial? It does! But you will never know how effective this approach is until you try it by yourself!</P></LI>
