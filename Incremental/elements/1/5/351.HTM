<P>The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible. Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part. Simplicity is imperative due to the way the brain works. There are two main reasons for which knowledge must be simple:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P><STRONG>Simple is easy</STRONG></P>
<P>By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process in always it the same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each repetition of complex material.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P><STRONG>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</STRONG></P>
<P>I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</A>). If you consider an item that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/stability.htm#stability_of_complex_items">keep the more difficult item in memory</A>. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split into<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>ten or more</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>simpler sub-items! Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!</P></LI></UL>
<P>Here is a striking example:</P>

<P>Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?<BR>A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters</P></TD></TR>

<P>You might want to experiment and try to learn two subjects using the two above approaches and see for yourself what advantage is brought by minimum information principle. This is particularly visible in the long perspective, i.e.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items</STRONG>!</P>
<P>Note in the example above how short the questions are. Note also that the answers are even shorter! We want a minimum amount of information to be retrieved from memory in a single repetition!<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible</STRONG>!</P>
<P>You will notice that the knowledge learned in the ill-structured example is not entirely equivalent to the well-structured formulation. For example, although you will remember why the Dead Sea can keep swimmers afloat, you may forget that it at all has such a characteristic in the first place! Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.</P>
<P>You will also lose the ability to fluently recite the description of the Dead Sea when called up to the blackboard by your teachers. I bet, however, that shining in front of the class is not your ultimate goal in learning.
