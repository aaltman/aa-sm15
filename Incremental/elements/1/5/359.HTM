<P>Note that the loss of information content in this item is inconsequential. During repetition you are only supposed to learn the name:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Quark</EM>. You should not hope that the trailing messages on the ownership of PageMaker and the year of its development will somehow trickle to your memory as a side effect. You should decide if the other pieces of information are important to you and if so, store them in separate items (perhaps reusing the above text, employing cloze deletion again and optimizing the wording in a new way). Otherwise the redundant information will only slow down your learning process!</P></LI>
