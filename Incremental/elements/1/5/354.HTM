<P>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a 10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!</P>
<P>Before you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge! This is indeed the easier part. The bottleneck lies in retaining memories for months, years or for lifetime! To accomplish the latter you will need<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein.</P>
<P>There have been dozens of books written about mnemonic techniques. Probably those written by Tony Buzan are most popular and respected. You can search the web for keywords such as:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>mind maps</EM>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>peg lists</EM>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>mnemonic techniques</EM>, etc.</P>
<P>Experience shows that with a dose of training you will need to consciously apply mnemonic techniques in only 1-5% of your items. With time, using mnemonic techniques will become automatic!</P>
