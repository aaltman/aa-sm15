<P>Referring to other memories can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference. In the example below, using the words<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>humble</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>supplicant</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>helps the student focus on the word<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>shamelessly</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and thus strengthen the correct semantics. Better focus helps eliminating interference. Secondly, the use of the words<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>humble</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>supplicant</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>makes it possible to avoid interference of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>cringing<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM>with these words themselves. Finally, the proposed wording is shorter and more specific. Naturally, the rules<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Build%20upon%20the%20basics">basics-to-details</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand">do not learn what you do not understand</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>require that the words<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>humble</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>supplicant</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>be learned beforehand (or at least at the same time)</P>
