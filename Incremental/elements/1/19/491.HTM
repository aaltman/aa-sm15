<LI>The tree-insertion algorithms we're previously seen add new nodes at the bottom of the tree, and then have to worry about whether doing so creates an imbalance. The B-tree insertion algorithm is just the opposite: it adds new nodes at the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>top</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>of the tree (a new node is allocated only when the root splits).

<LI>B-trees grow at the root, not at the leaves. Because of this, there is never any doubt that the tree is always perfectly height balanced: when a new node is added, all existing nodes become one level deeper in the tree.</LI></UL></H4>
