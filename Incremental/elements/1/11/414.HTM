It is actually the exactly same thing, except, outwardly we perceive it differently. Knowledge valuations bring a jolt of pleasure at discovering valuable knowledge. Problem valuations bring the same happiness when we discover a solution to a problem, which in essence is a piece of knowledge that closes the loop. Knowledge that clinches the deal. As much as passions can drive individuals to extreme heights of knowledge, innovation and discovery, they can also help individuals solve problems.</P>

This will lead to stress and procrastination. If the problem has been imposed on you by others or by circumstances, you may have no way out. Luckily, this does not make the problem unsolvable. It will only make your brain work less efficiently. You should not aim at quantum well if you struggle with fractions. I don't solve puzzles from housewife journals, even if they pose a bigger challenge than my own work.</P>

The difficulty may lead to procrastination. We may see reaching the solution as unlikely, or requiring a great deal of labor (e.g. plodding through tax laws and regulations, digging into details of some poorly organized technical specification, reams of manual mathematical calculations, etc.).</P>

Perhaps you can wriggle out. Perhaps you can replace Problem A with Problem B. Perhaps you can trade? Perhaps you can creatively procrastinate and the problem will self-resolve. Perhaps someone will do it for you? If you hate the problem, I will rather not be able to help you love it. Your problem valuation network is a great predictor, it is strong, it is biological, and it is stubborn. Let's see how it works. Perhaps you will find some room for improvement.</P></B>
