That got me thinking that the architecture of most internet news/comment infrastructures is built around &#8220;engagement&#8221; &#8212; effectively amplifying signals that are already strong and damping those that do not meet an interest threshold. While that approach certainly has a role, as a scientist it is also important for me to take note of topics that might be important, but which are currently generating little content. Bisection bandwidth of clustered computers seems to be one such topic&#8230;.</EM></P>
