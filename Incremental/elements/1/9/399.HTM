Creativity may be boosted artificially with drugs, of which coffee is my favorite. Different types of drugs can have different impacts on individual brain centers depending on the types of receptors used and even depending on the individual. We are all unique in terms of actual receptor type use and their distributions. LSD has been famously touted as a creativity drug. However, for problems solving, we need creativity that can be harnessed in the problem solving process. Randomization of thought cannot go as far as to make you lose your waking coherence. In healthy individuals, a cup of coffee is probably just enough to go high enough and still stay within limits of sanity.</P>

If you look at young people socializing in a bar, you can see that after a beer, their socializing becomes more creative. They perk up, chat more, get excited, and social disinhibition makes them forget that red pimple at the top of their nose. That's good for creativity. Naturally, if there is more beer involved, creativity gets quickly suppressed, and creative socializing turns into a slur. Alcohol is actually a depressant and can only form a temporary boost by its differentiating impact on different portions of the brain.
