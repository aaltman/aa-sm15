An absent minded professor is not as absent minded as the name implies, or else he would not be a professor. His brain is simply able to intensely focus attention on the chain of ideas that come from creative activity in a number of twinkling concept maps. The professor seems absent because he lives in the world of his ideas. A shot of a gun is bound to instantly set a specific focus map in the brain. This would quickly demonstrate that professor's mind is not really absent.</P>

He can do it through sheer will and curiosity! However, for a hard problem that does not budge, don't try to be a professor. Free yourself from distractions! That's the easy way to get the same result.</P>

In an ideal case, all you need to train is your ability to avoid distraction by petty things. In perfect isolation on an uninhabited island, your brain would probably quickly run out from petty things to think about. However, if you live in the modern society, the battle for your attention is relentless. If you are not in the driver seat, others will drive your life and you may as well forget about efficient problem solving.
