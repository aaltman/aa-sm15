<P><FONT class=extract>Trying to learn things you do not understand may seem like an utmost waste of time. Still, an amazing proportion of students commit the offence of learning without comprehension. Very often they have no other choice! The quality of many textbooks or lecture scripts is deplorable while examination deadlines are unmovable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If you are not a speaker of German, it is still possible to learn a history textbook in German. The book can be crammed word for word. However, the time needed for such "blind learning" is astronomical. Even more important: The value of such knowledge is negligible. If you cram a German book on history, you will still know nothing of history.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The German history book example is an extreme. However, the materials you learn may often seem well structured and you may tend to blame yourself for lack of comprehension. Soon you may pollute your learning process with a great deal of useless material that treacherously makes you believe "it will be useful some day".</FONT></P>
<LI>
<H4><A name="Learn before you memorize"><FONT class=extract>Learn before you memorize</FONT></A></H4>
<P><FONT class=extract>Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>build an overall picture of the learned knowledge</STRONG>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem of comprehension mentioned in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand"><FONT class=extract>Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. A single separated piece of your big picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>the principles of the internal combustion engine</EM>). Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</EM>), etc.</FONT></P>
<LI>
<H4><A name="Build upon the basics"><FONT class=extract>Build upon the basics</FONT></A></H4>
<P><FONT class=extract>The picture of the learned whole (as discussed in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Learn%20before%20you%20memorize"><FONT class=extract>Rule 2: Learn before you memorize</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend. You can always build upon them later on.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm"><FONT class=extract>you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a tiny proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on a basic fact can be very costly!</FONT></P>
<LI>
<H4><FONT class=extract>Stick to the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A name="minimum information principle"><FONT class=extract>minimum information principle</FONT></A></H4>
<P><FONT class=extract>The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible. Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part. Simplicity is imperative due to the way the brain works. There are two main reasons for which knowledge must be simple:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Simple is easy</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>By definition, simple material is easy to remember. This comes from the fact that its simplicity makes is easy for the brain to process in always it the same way. Imagine a labyrinth. When making a repetition of a piece of material, your brain is running through a labyrinth (you can view a neural network as a tangle of paths). While running through the labyrinth, the brain leaves a track on the walls. If it can run in only one unique way, the path is continuous and easy to follow. If there are many combinations, each run may leave a different trace that will interfere with other traces making it difficult to find the exit. The same happens on the cellular level with different synaptic connections being activated at each repetition of complex material.</FONT></P>
<LI>
<P><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>I assume you will make repetitions of the learned material using optimum inter-repetition intervals (as in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT class=extract>SuperMemo</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>). If you consider an item that is composed of two sub-items, you will need to make repetitions that are frequent enough to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/stability.htm#stability_of_complex_items"><FONT class=extract>keep the more difficult item in memory</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. If you split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time. Very often, inexperienced students create items that could easily be split into<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>ten or more</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>simpler sub-items! Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of (1) forgetting the complex item again and again, (2) repeating it in excessively short intervals or (3) actually remembering it only in part!</FONT></P></LI></UL>

<P><FONT class=extract>Visual cortex is that part of the brain in which visual stimuli are interpreted. It has been very well developed in the course of evolution and that is why we say<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>one picture is worth a thousand words</EM>. Indeed if you look at the number of details kept in a picture and the easiness with which your memory can retain them, you will notice that our verbal processing power is greatly inferior as compared with the visual processing power. The same refers to memory. A graphic representation of information is usually far less volatile.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Usually it takes much less time to formulate a simple question-and-answer pair than to find or produce a neat graphic image. This is why you will probably always have to weigh up cost and profits in using graphics in your learning material. Well-employed images will greatly reduce your learning time in areas such as anatomy, geography, geometry, chemistry, history, and many more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The power of imagery explains why the concept of Tony Buzan's mind maps is so popular. A mind map is an abstract picture in which connections between its components reflect the logical connections between individual concepts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>Mnemonic techniques are various techniques that make remembering easier. They are often amazingly effective. For most students, a picture of a 10-year-old memorizing a sequence of 50 playing cards verges on discovering a young genius. It is very surprising then to find out how easy it is to learn the techniques that make it possible with a dose of training. These techniques are available to everyone and do not require any special skills!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Before you start believing that mastering such techniques will provide you with an eternal solution to the problem of forgetting, be warned that the true bottleneck towards long-lasting and useful memories is not in quickly memorizing knowledge!

To accomplish the latter you will need<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/english/smintro.htm"><FONT class=extract>SuperMemo</FONT></A><FONT class=extract><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and the compliance with the 20 rules presented herein.</FONT></P>

For example:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>What countries belong to the European Union?</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>You should avoid such items whenever possible due to the high cost of retaining memories based on sets. If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them into<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT class=extract>enumerations</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. Enumerations are ordered lists of members (for example, the alphabetical list of the members of the EU). Enumerations are also hard to remember and should be avoided. However, the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order. An ordered list of countries contains more information than the set of countries that can be listed in any order. Paradoxically, despite containing more information, enumerations are easier to remember. The reason for this has been discussed earlier in the context of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum%20information%20principle"><FONT class=extract>minimum information principle</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition</STRONG>. In the case of sets, listing members in varying order at each repetition has a disastrous effect on memory. It is nearly impossible to memorize sets containing more than five members without the use of mnemonic techniques, enumeration, grouping, etc. Despite this claim, you will often succeed due to subconsciously mastered techniques that help you go around this problem. Those techniques, however, will fail you all too often. For that reason:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Avoid sets!</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>If you need them badly, convert them into enumerations and use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations"><FONT class=extract>techniques for dealing with enumerations</FONT></A></P>

They joined the union in the company of others but have been listed as separate items to simplify the learning process.

<P><FONT class=extract>When you learn about similar things you often confuse them. For example, you may have problems distinguishing between the meanings of the words<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>historic</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>historical</EM>. This will even be more visible if you memorize lots of numbers, e.g. optimum dosages of drugs in pharmacotherapy. If knowledge of one item makes it harder to remember another item, we have a case of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>memory interference</STRONG>. You can often remember an item for years with straight excellent grades until ... you memorize another item that makes it nearly impossible to remember either! For example, if you learn geography and you memorize that the country located between Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil is Guyana, you are likely to easily recall this fact for years with just a couple of repetitions. However, once you add similar items asking about the location of all these countries, and French Guyana, and Colombia and more, you will suddenly notice strong memory interference and you may experience unexpected forgetting. In simple terms: you will get confused about what is what.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Interference is probably the single greatest cause of forgetting in collections of an experienced user of SuperMemo. You can never be sure when it strikes, and the only hermetic procedure against it is to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>detect and eliminate</STRONG>. In other words, in many cases it may be impossible to predict interference at the moment of formulating knowledge. Interference can also occur between remotely related items like Guyana, Guyard and Guyenne, as well as Guyana, kayman and ... aspirin. It may work differently for you and for your colleague. It is very hard to predict.</FONT></P>

Instead of just<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>memorizing</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation) and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>generate</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>the answer. In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>derivation steps</STRONG>: in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended (e.g. solving complex mathematical problems). It is not cramming! It is making sure that the brain can always follow the fastest path while solving the problem. For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm"><FONT class=extract>Roots of genius and creativity</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>, as well as more specific:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Intelligence"><FONT class=extract>Derivation, reasoning and intelligence</FONT></A><FONT class=extract> </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>multiple semantic representation</STRONG>: very often the same knowledge can be represented and viewed from different angles. Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value. This will increase the expected recall rate (beyond that specified with the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm"><FONT class=extract>forgetting index</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>)! </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>flexible repetition</STRONG>: if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices. For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>a mark made by ink spilt on sth</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>=<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>blot/blob/blotch</EM>) </FONT>

<P><FONT class=extract>Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>2+2=4</EM>), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge. In real-life situation you will often be confronted with challenges to your knowledge. Sources can come to your rescue. You will also find that facts and figures differ depending on the source. You can really be surprised how frivolously reputable information agencies publish figures that are drastically different from other equally reputable sources. Without SuperMemo, those discrepancies are often difficult to notice: before you encounter the new fact, the old one is often long forgotten. With sources provided, you will be able to make more educated choices on which pieces of information are more reliable. Adding reliability labels may also be helpful (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Watch out!, Other sources differ!</EM>, etc.). Sources should accompany your items but should not be part of the learned knowledge (unless it is critical for you to be able to recall the source whenever asked).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.). It is important that you provide your items with time stamping or other tags indicating the degree of obsolescence. In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected. When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version. Once you have newer figures you can update your items. Unfortunately, in most cases you will have to re-memorize knowledge that became outdated. Date stamping is useful in editing and verifying your knowledge; however, you will rarely want to memorize stamping itself. If you would like to remember the changes of a given figure in time (e.g. GNP figures over a number of years), the date stamping becomes the learned knowledge itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>You will always face far more knowledge that you will be able to master. That is why prioritizing is critical for building quality knowledge in the long-term. The way you prioritize will affect the way your knowledge slots in. This will also affect the speed of learning (e.g. see:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Build%20upon%20the%20basics"><FONT class=extract>learn basics first</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>). There are many stages at which prioritizing will take place; only few are relevant to knowledge representation, but all are important:</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Prioritizing sources</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>- there will always be a number of sources of your knowledge. If you are still at student years: these will most likely be books and notes pertaining to different subjects. Otherwise you will probably rely more on journals, Internet, TV, newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. It is always worth being aware what is the optimum proportion of time devoted to those varied sources. As you progress with learning, you will quickly develop a good sense of which learning slots bring better results and which might be extended at the cost of others </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Extracting knowledge</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>- unless you are about to pass an important exam, it nearly never makes sense to memorize whole books or whole articles. You will need to extract those parts that are most likely to impact the quality of your knowledge. You can do it by (1) marking paragraphs in a book or journal, (2) pasting relevant web pages to SuperMemo, (3) pasting relevant passages to SuperMemo, (4) typing facts and figures directly to SuperMemo notes, etc. You will need some experience before you can accurately measure how much knowledge you can indeed transfer to your brain and what degree of detail you can feasibly master. Your best way to prioritize the flow of knowledge into your memory is to use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/read.htm"><FONT class=extract>incremental reading</FONT></A><FONT class=extract><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>tools </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Transferring knowledge to SuperMemo</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>- you may try to stick with the 20 rules of formulating knowledge at the moment of introducing your material to SuperMemo. However, you can also literally transfer your notes or import whole files and later use the mechanisms provided by SuperMemo to determine the order of processing the imported material. Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items. If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import. Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Formulating items</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>- make sure that explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses so that your attention is focused on the most important part of the item. The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Using forgetting index</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>- you can use the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A href="https://super-memory.com/help/fi.htm"><FONT class=extract>forgetting index</FONT></A><FONT class=extract><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to prioritize pending items.
