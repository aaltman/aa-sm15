<P>The picture of the learned whole (as discussed in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Learn%20before%20you%20memorize">Rule 2: Learn before you memorize</A>) does not have to be complete to the last detail. Just the opposite, the simpler the picture the better. The shorter the initial chapter of your book the better. Simple models are easier to comprehend. You can always build upon them later on.</P>
<P>Do not neglect the basics. Memorizing seemingly obvious things is not a waste of time! Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little. Better err on the safe side. Remember that usually<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm">you spend 50% of your time repeating just 3-5% of the learned material</A>! Basics are usually easy to retain and take a tiny proportion of your time. However, each memory lapse on a basic fact can be very costly!
