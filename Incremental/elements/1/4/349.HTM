<P>Before you proceed with memorizing individual facts and rules, you need to<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>build an overall picture of the learned knowledge</STRONG>. Only when individual pieces fit to build a single coherent structure will you be able to dramatically reduce the learning time. This is closely related to the problem of comprehension mentioned in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Do%20not%20learn%20if%20you%20do%20not%20understand">Rule 1: Do not learn if you do not understand</A>. A single separated piece of your big picture is like a single German word in the textbook of history.</P>
<P>Do not start from memorizing loosely related facts! First read a chapter in your book that puts them together (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>the principles of the internal combustion engine</EM>). Only then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers (e.g.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>What moves the pistons in the internal combustion engine?</EM>), etc.</P></LI>
