<H2 id=h-processing-data-apache-flink-vs-kafka-streams class=wp-block-heading><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Processing Data: Apache Flink vs Kafka Streams</FONT></STRONG></H2>
<P><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> is an open-source, unified stream and batch data processing framework. It&nbsp; is a distributed computing system that can process large amounts of data in real-time with fault tolerance and scalability.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>On the other hand, <STRONG>Kafka Streams </STRONG>is a specific library built into Apache Kafka that provides a framework for building different applications and microservices that process data in real-time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Kafka Streams provides a programming model that allows developers to define transformation operations over data streams using <STRONG>DSL-like functional APIs</STRONG>. This model is based on two types of APIs: the <STRONG>DSL API</STRONG> and the<STRONG> Processor API</STRONG>.&nbsp; The <STRONG>DSL API</STRONG> is built on top of the Processor API and is recommended especially for beginners. The <STRONG>Processor API</STRONG> is meant for advanced applications development and involves the employment of low-level Kafka capabilities.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Kafka Streams was created to provide a native option for processing streaming data without the need for external frameworks or libraries. A Kafka Streams job is essentially a standalone application that can be orchestrated at the user&#8217;s discretion.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<H2 id=h-main-differences class=wp-block-heading><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Main Differences</FONT></STRONG></H2>
<P><FONT class=extract>As previously mentioned, Flink is a running engine on which processing jobs run, while Kafka Streams is a Java library that enables client applications to run streaming jobs without the need for extra distributed systems besides a running Kafka cluster. This implies that if users want to leverage Flink for stream processing, they will need to work with two systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>In addition, both Apache Flink and Kafka Streams offer high-level APIs (Flink DataStream APIs, Kafka Streams DSL) as well as advanced APIs for more complex implementations, such as the Kafka Streams Processor APIs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Now, let&#8217;s take a closer look at the main differences between Apache Kafka and Flink.</FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Integrations</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract>How do these systems establish connections with the external world? <STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> offers native integration with a wide range of technologies, including Hadoop, RDBMS, Elasticsearch, Hive, and more. This integration is made possible through the utilization of the Flink Connectors suite, where these connectors function as sources within Flink pipelines.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Kafka Streams</STRONG> is tightly integrated with Kafka for processing streaming data. The Kafka ecosystem provides Kafka Connect, which allows for the integration of external data sources as events are journaled into topics. For example, using the Kafka Connect Debezium connector, users can stream&nbsp; Change Data Capture stream events into a Kafka topic. A Kafka Stream topology can then consume this topic and apply processing logic to meet specific business requirements.</FONT></P>
<OL start=2>
<LI><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Scalability</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;<STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> is an engine designed to scale out across a cluster of machines, and its scalability is only bound by the cluster definition. On the other hand, while it is possible to scale<STRONG> Kafka Streams</STRONG> applications out horizontally, the potential scalability is limited to the maximum number of partitions owned by the source topics.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<OL start=3>
<LI><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Fault tolerance and reliability</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;Both Kafka Streams and&nbsp; Apache Flink ensure high availability and fault tolerance, but they employ different approaches. <STRONG>Kafka Stream</STRONG> delegates to the capabilities of Kafka brokers. <STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> depends&nbsp; on external systems for persistent state management by using tiered storage and it relies on systems like Zookeeper or Kubernetes for achieving high availability.</FONT></P>
<OL start=4>
<LI><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Operation</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract><STRONG>&nbsp;Kafka Stream</STRONG> as a library, requires users to write their applications and operate them as they would normally. For example, a Kubernetes deployment can be used for this purpose and by adding Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) , it can enable horizontal scale-out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract><STRONG>&nbsp;Apache Flink</STRONG> is an engine that needs to be orchestrated in order to enable Flink workloads. Currently, Flink users can leverage a Kubernetes Flink operator developed by the community to integrate Flink executions natively over Kubernetes clusters.</FONT></P>
<OL start=5>
<LI><STRONG><FONT class=extract>Windowing&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract>Both Kafka Stream and Flink support windowing (tumbling, sliding, session) with some differences:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Kafka Stream</STRONG> manages windowing based on event time and processing time. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> manages flexible windowing based on event time, processing time, and ingestion time.</FONT></LI></UL>

<P><FONT class=extract>The learning curve of a technology is not always an objective fact and can vary depending on various factors. However, we have attempted to provide a general overview based on factors like resources availability and examples.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The basic concepts of <STRONG>Kafka Streams</STRONG>, such as KStreams (data streams) and KTables (data tables), can be easily grasped.
