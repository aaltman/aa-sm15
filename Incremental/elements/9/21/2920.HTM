<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">In a distributed system a caching layer can reside on each machine in the application service cluster, or it can be implemented in a cluster isolated from the application service.</SPAN></P>
<P>A <STRONG>private</STRONG> cache exists in the memory of each application computer in the service cluster. Since each machine stores its own cache, the cached data will get out of sync based on what requests have been directed to that machine, and at what time.</P>
<P>The main advantage of in-memory distributed caches is speed - since the cache is in memory, it&#8217;s going to function a lot faster than a shared caching layer that requires network requests to operate. <STRONG>Redis</STRONG> and <STRONG>Memcached</STRONG> are two common choices for private cache implementations.&nbsp;</P>

<P>A <STRONG>shared</STRONG> cache exists in an isolated layer. In fact, the application might not be aware that there&#8217;s a cache. This allows the cache layer and application layer to be scaled independently, and for many different types of application services to use the same cache.</P>
<P>The application layer needs to be able to detect the availability of the shared cache, and to switch over to the primary data store if the shared cache ever goes down. A shared cache implemented on its own cluster has the same resiliency considerations as any distributed system - including failovers, recovery, partitioning, rebalancing, and concurrency.&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG alt="Shared cache" src="https://d3no4ktch0fdq4.cloudfront.net/public/CACHE/images/blog-articles/content-images/Diagram_6_2x_1_1024x1024/65b08eb3d3ef16f551985531dd16935e.webp" width=660 height=660 loading="lazy"></P>
<P>Private and shared caches can be used together, just like CPU architectures have different levels of caching. The private cache can also be a fallback that retains the advantages of caching in case the shared cache layer fails.</P>
