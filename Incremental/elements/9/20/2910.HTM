<b> : </b><STRONG>1.2 How a cache is used by an application</STRONG></H3>
<P>When a data request goes through a cache, a copy of the data is either already in the cache, which is called a <STRONG>cache hit</STRONG>, or it&#8217;s not and the data has to be fetched from the primary store and copied into the cache, which is called a <STRONG>cache miss</STRONG>. A cache is performing well when there are many more cache hits than cache misses.&nbsp;</P>
