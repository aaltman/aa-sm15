<b> : </b><B>3.2 Idempotent APIs</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">APIs can have the feature of </SPAN><B>idempotency </B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">to ensure consistent interactions with a shared resource. An API is idempotent when the same request sent multiple times will not produce any inconsistent results. When reading from a resource, this means the response will always be the same value. When writing, this means the update will only happen once.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">For example, idempotent </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">writes </SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">can be implemented by requiring request ids so the system can tell if a request is being retried. Idempotency is also supported by other features we've talked about, like locking and database transactions. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">An intuitive example of an idempotent API is bank account transfers: if a user initiates an online bank transfer and their internet goes down halfway through processing, you want to make sure the user can initiate the transfer again and your system will correctly only transfer the amount </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">once</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">.</SPAN>
