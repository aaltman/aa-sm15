<b> : </b><STRONG>1.1 The purpose of caching</STRONG></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Caching is based on the&nbsp;<B data-stringify-type="bold">principle of locality</B>, which means that programs repeatedly access data located close to each other.&nbsp;There are two kinds of locality:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Temporal locality</STRONG>, where data that has been referenced recently is likely to be referenced again (i.e. <EM>time-based</EM> locality).</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Spatial locality</STRONG>, where data that is stored near recently referenced data is also likely to be referenced (i.e. <EM>space-based&nbsp;</EM>locality).</LI></UL>
<P>We can speed up&nbsp;a system by making it faster to retrieve this locally relevant data. Caching does this by storing a &#8220;cached&#8221; copy of the data, in a smaller, faster data store. For example a CPU has a cache in specialized SRAM memory on the processor so it doesn&#8217;t have to go all the way to RAM or Disk.&nbsp;
