<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Paxos is a general consensus protocol that can be used for asynchronous leader election. Quite a lot of research has been done about the Paxos family of algorithms, which means it's both robust and there's </SPAN><A href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/12/paxos-simple-Copy.pdf"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">much more to say about it</SPAN></A><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> than we have space for in this article.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">You don&#8217;t need to know all the details of Paxos for designing systems, in fact for leader election generally it&#8217;s best to choose an existing implementation because of the complexity. It&#8217;s unlikely that your system will have a feature constraint that isn&#8217;t already covered by an existing open source library or service. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Very briefly, Paxos uses </SPAN><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">state machine replication</SPAN></A><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> to model the distributed system, and then chooses a leader by having some nodes propose a leader, and some nodes accept proposals. When a </SPAN><B>quorum</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> of (enough of) the accepting nodes choose the same proposed leader, that proposed leader becomes the actual leader.</SPAN>
