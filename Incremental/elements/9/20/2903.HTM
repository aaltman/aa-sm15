<b> : </b><B>2.4 Apache ZooKeeper (ZAB)</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Apache Zookeeper is a centralized coordination service that is </SPAN><A href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Index"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&#8220;itself distributed and highly reliable.&#8221;</SPAN></A><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> The ethos behind Apache ZooKeeper is that coordination in distributed systems is difficult, and it&#8217;s better to have a shared open source implementation with all the key elements so that your service doesn&#8217;t have to reimplement everything from scratch. This is especially helpful in large distributed systems.</SPAN></P>
<P><B>ZAB</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast) is the protocol used by Apache ZooKeeper to handle leader election, replication order guarantees, and node recovery. It is called this because the leader &#8220;broadcasts&#8221; state changes to followers to make sure writes are consistent and propagated to all nodes. ZAB is an asynchronous algorithm. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">ZAB is focused on making sure the history of the cluster is accurate through leadership transitions. The leader is chosen such that it has the most up to date history (it has seen the most recent transaction). When enough of the nodes agree that the new leader has the most up to date history, it syncs history with the cluster and finishes the election by recording itself as leader.&nbsp;</SPAN>
