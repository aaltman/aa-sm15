<b> : </b><STRONG>Use Cases</STRONG></H2>
<P>While both frameworks offer unique features and benefits, they have different strengths when it comes to specific use cases.&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Apache Flink </STRONG>is the go-to choice for:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Real-Time Data Processing:</STRONG> real-time event analysis, performance monitoring, anomaly detection, and IoT sensor data processing.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Complex Event Processing: </STRONG>pattern recognition, aggregation, and related event processing, such as detecting sequences of events or managing time windows.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Batch Data Processing: </STRONG>report generation and archives data processing.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Machine Learning on Streaming Data:</STRONG> train and apply machine learning models on streaming data, enabling real-time processing of machine learning outcomes and predictions.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Kafka Stream </STRONG>is the go-to choice for:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Microservices Architectures:</STRONG> particularly leveraged for the implementations of event-driven patterns like event sourcing or CQRS.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Kafka Input and Output Data Processing: </STRONG>transform, filter, aggregate or enrich input data and produce output data in real-time.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Log Data Processing:</STRONG> analyze website access logs, monitor service performance, or detect significant events from system logs.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Real-time Analytics:</STRONG> data aggregation, real-time reporting, and triggering event-based actions</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Machine Learning</STRONG>:&nbsp; train and apply machine learning models on streaming data for real-time scoring.</LI></UL>
