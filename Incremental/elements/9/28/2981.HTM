<b> : </b><STRONG>Processing Data: Apache Flink vs Kafka Streams</STRONG></H2>
<P><STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG> is an open-source, unified stream and batch data processing framework. It&nbsp; is a distributed computing system that can process large amounts of data in real-time with fault tolerance and scalability.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <STRONG>Kafka Streams </STRONG>is a specific library built into Apache Kafka that provides a framework for building different applications and microservices that process data in real-time.</P>
<P>Kafka Streams provides a programming model that allows developers to define transformation operations over data streams using <STRONG>DSL-like functional APIs</STRONG>. This model is based on two types of APIs: the <STRONG>DSL API</STRONG> and the<STRONG> Processor API</STRONG>.&nbsp; The <STRONG>DSL API</STRONG> is built on top of the Processor API and is recommended especially for beginners. The <STRONG>Processor API</STRONG> is meant for advanced applications development and involves the employment of low-level Kafka capabilities.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kafka Streams was created to provide a native option for processing streaming data without the need for external frameworks or libraries. A Kafka Streams job is essentially a standalone application that can be orchestrated at the user&#8217;s discretion.&nbsp;
