<b> : </b><STRONG>Learning curve and resources</STRONG></H2>
<P>The learning curve of a technology is not always an objective fact and can vary depending on various factors. However, we have attempted to provide a general overview based on factors like resources availability and examples.</P>
<P>The basic concepts of <STRONG>Kafka Streams</STRONG>, such as KStreams (data streams) and KTables (data tables), can be easily grasped. While the mastery of advanced functions such as the aggregation of time windows or the processing of correlated events, may require further exploration. The official Kafka Streams documentation, available on Kafka&#8217;s website at <A role=link href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/</A> serves as a valuable reference for learning, exploring and leveraging all its capabilities.</P>
<P>To get started with <STRONG>Apache Flink</STRONG>, it is recommended to learn the basic programming model, including working with data streams and data sets. Once again, mastering advanced concepts such as state management, time windows, or grouping, may require additional study and practice time. The official Flink documentation available on Confluent&#8217;s website at <A role=link href="https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/">https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/</A> serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and exploring as well.
