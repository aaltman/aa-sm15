<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Short polling is the original polling protocol for clients to get regular information updates from a server. The steps of short polling are:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Client sends Server an HTTP request for new information.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Server responds with new information, or no information.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Client repeats the request at a set interval (e.g. 2s)</SPAN></LI></UL>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The advantages of Short polling are that it&#8217;s very simple and widely supported because it&#8217;s part of the HTTP. The downside of short polling is that it has a lot of request overhead from both sides: the client has to constantly make new requests, and the server has to handle them whether or not there&#8217;s new information. In practice if you want a polling connection, long polling is preferred to short polling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
