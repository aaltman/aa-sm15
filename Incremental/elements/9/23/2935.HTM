<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Long polling is a more efficient version of short polling. The steps of long polling are:</SPAN></P>

<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Client sends Server and HTTP request for new information</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Server waits until there&#8217;s new information to respond (a &#8220;hanging&#8221; response)</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Client repeats the request as soon as it gets the previous response back</SPAN></LI></UL>

<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Long polling cuts down the number of HTTP requests necessary to transmit the same amount of data to the client. The server has to be able to &#8220;hold&#8221; unfulfilled client requests, and handle the case where it gets new information to send, but the client hasn&#8217;t sent a new request yet. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The benefits of long polling are that it&#8217;s part of the HTTP protocol, so it&#8217;s widely supported, and it produces less traffic than short polling because it takes fewer requests. In order to support this, the server-side implementation is slightly more complex than short polling, but not nearly as complex as the other two protocols we&#8217;ll look at: Websockets and Server Sent Events. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">There are a few drawbacks to long polling. In some implementations holding unfulfilled requests can take more server resources than short polling, and limit the overall number of possible connections. Also if there are multiple open requests from the same client, message ordering can&#8217;t be guaranteed, and messages can get lost. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Overall, long polling is a good strategy when you need a simple implementation for regularly updating clients with new information, like updating a dashboard every minute with new data. It won&#8217;t handle high volume data streams, and is still slowed down by the overhead of repeatedly reestablishing a connection between server and client.&nbsp;</SPAN>
