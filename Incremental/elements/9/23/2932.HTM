<b> : </b><B>1. Purpose of polling, SSE, and WebSockets</B></H2>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The internet is built on the HTTP standard for communicating data between web browsers and web servers. The client, in most cases a web browser, makes an HTTP request to the server, which sends back the appropriate response. This roundtrip is what happens when you type an address like '</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><A href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com</A>'</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&nbsp;into your browser, and you get a web page back.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The HTTP standard is widely supported and very functional. But when your application needs to transmit continuous information streams or real-time updates to clients, like a collaborative document editor that shows changes in real time. In cases like this, having to repeatedly make regular HTTP requests will slow things down. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">That&#8217;s where polling, WebSockets, and&nbsp;SSE come in. These are three protocols that specifically focus on speed and memory efficiency for data streams. Which approach you&#8217;d want to use in a system depends on the use case. So, let&#8217;s&nbsp; go over how each of these protocols work, and when to use them.</SPAN>
