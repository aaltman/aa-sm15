<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">The main benefit of an error budget is that it provides a common incentive that allows both product development and SRE to focus on finding the right balance between innovation and reliability.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Many products use this control loop to manage release velocity: as long as the system&#8217;s SLOs are met, releases can continue. If SLO violations occur frequently enough to expend the error budget, releases are temporarily halted while additional resources are invested in system testing and development to make the system more resilient, improve its performance, and so on. More subtle and effective approaches are available than this simple on/off technique:<SUP style="FONT-SIZE: 11px; TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255); LINE-HEIGHT: 0"><A id=id-bb2umSeIPu8iV-marker class=jumptarget style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255); OUTLINE-WIDTH: 0px; OUTLINE-STYLE: none; OUTLINE-COLOR: invert" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/#id-bb2umSeIPu8iV" data-type="noteref">15</A></SUP><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>for instance, slowing down releases or rolling them back when the SLO-violation error budget is close to being used up.
