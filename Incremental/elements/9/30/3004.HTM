<P>The Android Transport Layer (see <A href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/fcm-architecture"><SPAN class=notranslate>FCM</SPAN> architecture</A>) uses point-to-point encryption. Depending on your needs, you may decide to add end-to-end encryption to data messages. <SPAN class=notranslate>FCM</SPAN> does not provide an end-to-end solution. However, there are external solutions available such as <A href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/project-capillary-end-to-end-encryption.html">Capillary</A> or <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security">DTLS</A>.
