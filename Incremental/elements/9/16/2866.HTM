<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">The house robber problem (max non-adjacent sums) took a couple of attempts.</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">The successful one used iteration.&nbsp; It had two base cases, a list of length 1 and a list of length 2.&nbsp; length 1 is trivial, length 2 is the max of the values of the first two indices (since they can't sum) and then initializes the dp array in case we have length greater than 2.</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">We then iterate through to the right, and check backwards for matching dp values starting at i - 2 (not i - 1, since that's a neighbor).&nbsp; We take the max of the dp values found and add it to the current, for the current dp, and check if we have a new max.&nbsp; Then we return.</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">There was a gotcha here that iterating backwards over a list requires arguments to range as follows: range(i - 2, -1, -1).&nbsp; The second argument -1 needs to be -1 rather than 0 because the range terminates BEFORE it gets to 0 or -1.&nbsp; We want it inclusive of the zeroth element, so use -1.</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">The previous attempt tried to do recursive.&nbsp; I think I didn't sufficiently think through my recursive cases in order to finish.&nbsp; Reminder to self to draw out the tree and think hard about the base cases before I start writing code.</P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">Problem statement:</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">&nbsp;</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">You are given an integer array <CODE class="hljs language-ebnf" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">nums</CODE> where <CODE class="hljs language-css" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">nums[i]</CODE> represents the amount of money the <CODE class="hljs language-css" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">i</CODE>th house has. The houses are arranged in a straight line, i.e. the <CODE class="hljs language-css" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">i</CODE>th house is the neighbor of the <CODE class="hljs language-clojure" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">(i-1)</CODE>th and <CODE class="hljs language-clojure" style="FONT-SIZE: 14px">(i+1)</CODE>th house.</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 17px">You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob <STRONG>two adjacent houses</STRONG> because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were <EM>both</EM> broken into.</P>
