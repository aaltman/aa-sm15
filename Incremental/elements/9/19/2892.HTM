<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Since L7 LBs need to examine the request to make routing decisions, any encrypted requests (HTTPS) need to be decrypted. That means an L7 LB will terminate the TCP connection with the request source and start a new connection to pass the request to the backend servers. This new request can be encrypted or not, depending how much you trust your backend server network. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Load Balancers are also a natural point of protection against DDOS attacks. Since they generally prevent server overload by distributing requests well, in the case of a DDOS attack the LB makes it harder to overload the whole system. They also remove a single point of failure, and therefore make the system harder to attack. </SPAN>
