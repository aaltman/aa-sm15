<b> : </b><B>1.1 Advantages of load balancing</B></H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Enable horizontal scaling:</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> spinning up multiple instances of a service is not possible without a load balancer directing traffic efficiently to the cluster.&nbsp;</SPAN></LI>
<LI><B>Dynamic scaling</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: it's possible to seamlessly add and remove servers to respond to load.</SPAN></LI>
<LI><B>Abstraction</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: the end user only needs to know the address of the load balancer, not the address of every server in the cluster.</SPAN></LI>
<LI><B>Throughput</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: service availability and response time are unaffected by overall traffic.</SPAN></LI>
<LI><B>Redundancy</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: distributing load over a cluster means no one server is a single point of failure. Note that the load balancer itself must also not become a single point of failure.</SPAN></LI>
<LI><B>Continuous deployment</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: it's possible to roll out software updates without taking the whole service down, by using the load balancer to take out one machine at a time.</SPAN></LI></UL>
