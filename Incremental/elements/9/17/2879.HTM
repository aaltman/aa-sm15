<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Availability is the amount of time that a system is able to respond, that is the ratio of</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. Availability is a critical metric of performance for a service, because downtime can both harm users who rely on the systems and cause a business to lose large profits in a short amount of time. </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Availability is so important that infrastructure services like <A href="https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/">AWS</A> and <A href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla">Google Cloud</A> will guarantee certain uptimes in their service-level agreements (SLAs).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The gold standard for "highly available" systems is the </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">five nines</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">: 99.999% uptime. This might seem like an excessively precise number, but 90% uptime is about 17 hours of downtime a week, and 99% is about 1.7 hours of downtime a week, which is a fair amount of time for a service to be </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">regularly</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> unavailable.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Five nines availability can be misleading though if it&#8217;s not balanced by other aspects of performance and user experience. Uptime doesn&#8217;t matter that much if it takes a minute to respond to every user request. It&#8217;s important to make sure good latency and throughput are maintained while designing a highly available system.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">It&#8217;s also important to think about when downtimes happen. A business will be notably affected if all downtimes occur at unfortunate high-use moments, like major shopping holidays. It can be just as advantageous to plan longer downtimes for maintenance at low-activity times and not achieve five nines availability, if it means the system will be able to function properly under peak use.</SPAN>
