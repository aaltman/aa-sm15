<b> : </b><B>3.1 What causes low availability</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Downtime happens when part of the service breaks, like a hardware component fails, or a deployment goes wrong so the software is inconsistent. Systems can fail in many ways, and here are some of the most common:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Hardware failure</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - computer components eventually fail, and this can take down a key server causing the whole system to stop working. A whole system can also be taken down if there&#8217;s a power outage or natural disaster at the data center.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Software bugs</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - when something in the code is wrong, a request can run into a bug and the code can be killed (e.g. a null pointer is dereferenced)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Complex architectures</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - the more complex a system design is, the more points of failure there are, and the harder it gets to synchronize more&nbsp;computers and make them fault tolerant to other computers in the system failing.&nbsp;</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Dependent service outages</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - an outage of a service that the system relies on, like DNS or an authorization server, can cause the system to become unavailable even if nothing is broken internally.&nbsp;</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Request overload</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - if a system reaches its maximum capacity, it can start failing to respond to some requests. Too many requests can also cause the computer to shut down if it runs out of a key resource and can&#8217;t process any more operations (e.g. the disk space fills up).</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Deployment issues</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">&nbsp;-&nbsp;when a deployment is conducted and the changes to software or configurations don&#8217;t go as expected, a number of problems can arise that could make the system unavailable. For example, deployment issues could put the servers in an inconsistent state, prevent them from starting, prevent them from talking to each other, or they might&nbsp;run short on&nbsp;resources.&nbsp;</SPAN></LI></UL>
