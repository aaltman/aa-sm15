<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Congestion</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - just like road traffic is caused by many people trying to get to the same destination, low throughput in a software system can be caused by too many requests on the same network. Essentially, the hardware can't handle the number of requests going through it.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Protocol overhead</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - if the protocols used in message transmission require handshakes and other back-and-forth communication patterns, the network can be overloaded with overhead from just the protocols and not the message content itself.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Latency</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - since throughput is the amount of data transmitted over a set time period, high latencies (i.e. slow data transmission speeds) will reduce the amount of data that is transmitted overall.</SPAN></LI></UL>
