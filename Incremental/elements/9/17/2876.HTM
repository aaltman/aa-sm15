<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Throughput is the amount of data that is successfully transmitted through a system in a certain amount of time, measured in bits per second (bps). Throughput is a measurement of how much is actually transmitted, and it is not the theoretical capacity (bandwidth) of the system.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Latency, throughput, and bandwidth can be easy to confuse, but it&#8217;s very similar to a system you&#8217;re probably already familiar with: traffic of cars on the road. Latency is how long it takes you to drive from A to B, bandwidth is how wide the roads are, and throughput is how many cars are on the road right now.</SPAN></P>
