<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Better paths:</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> minimizing the number of nodes a request has to travel through can help improve latencies.&nbsp;</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Caching:</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> caching can dramatically improve latencies when applied correctly, by storing a copy of repeatedly accessed data for faster retrieval.</SPAN></LI>
<LI style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"><B>Protocol choice</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> - certain protocols, like HTTP/2, intentionally reduce the amount of protocol overhead associated with a request, and can keep latency lower. TCP also has congestion avoidance features that can help mitigate congestion-related causes of high latencies.</SPAN></LI></UL>
