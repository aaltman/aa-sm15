<P>Flink is built to scale out to thousands of nodes, allowing it to efficiently handle large-scale, stateful computations. It supports many use cases, from simple data transformations to complex event-driven applications and analytics. It also integrates with many storage systems and has rich connectors for various data sources and sinks.</P>
<P>However, managing and operating a Flink cluster can be complex, requiring a good understanding of the system&#8217;s internals. Flink can be overkill for smaller workloads, as it's designed for heavy-duty, continuous processing tasks.</P>
