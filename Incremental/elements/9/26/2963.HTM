<TD>Excels in high-throughput, low-latency scenarios, especially in large-scale streaming applications.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Scalability</TD>
<TD>Effectively scales within Kafka-centric environments, handling medium to large data streams with ease.</TD>
<TD>Demonstrates superior scalability, capable of managing complex and voluminous data streams.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Ease of use</TD>
<TD>User-friendly, especially for those familiar with Kafka, thanks to its integration and straightforward setup.</TD>
<TD>Has a steeper learning curve but provides rich features and extensive documentation for skilled users.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Ecosystem support</TD>
<TD>Benefits from strong integration and support within the Kafka ecosystem.</TD>
<TD>Features a broad and active community with extensive integrations and tools for diverse streaming needs.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Use cases</TD>
<TD>Best suited for applications deeply integrated with Kafka, such as stream processing at a moderate scale and real-time analytics.</TD>
<TD>Ideal for complex event processing, large-scale applications, and scenarios requiring advanced streaming capabilities.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Fault tolerance</TD>
<TD>Provides adequate fault tolerance primarily through Kafka&#8217;s built-in mechanisms.</TD>
<TD>Offers advanced fault tolerance with a robust checkpointing strategy, positioning it as a leader in this area.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Handling late-arriving events</TD>
<TD>Capable of managing late-arriving events but may be limited in more complex scenarios.</TD>
<TD>Offers sophisticated handling of late-arriving events with flexible event time processing.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Programming flexibility</TD>
<TD>Focused mainly on Java, with constrained support for other programming languages.</TD>
<TD>Supports various programming languages and offers API abstractions like PyFlink and Table APIs for enhanced flexibility.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV>
