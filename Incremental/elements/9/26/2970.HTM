<b> : </b>Programming model: Kafka Streams vs. Flink</H2>
<P>Kafka Streams is tightly integrated with the Java ecosystem, and while it does offer a straightforward approach for those familiar with Java, it limits developers to this language.</P>
<P>Flink is designed with flexibility in mind, supporting multiple programming languages such as Java, Scala, and Python (through PyFlink). Additionally, Flink provides a variety of API abstractions, including the DataStream API for stream processing, DataSet API for batch processing, and the Table API and SQL for declarative programming. This range of options caters to a broader spectrum of developers and use cases, allowing for a choice that best fits the problem.
