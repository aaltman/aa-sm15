<b> : </b>Strengths and limitations</H3>
<P>Kafka Streams is inherently designed to work with Kafka, leading to straightforward setups and configurations for those already using Kafka. It offers a simple path for building streaming applications without needing a separate cluster or infrastructure besides Kafka. Leveraging Kafka&#8217;s robustness, it naturally scales with Kafka clusters and maintains high reliability.</P>
<P>Kafka Streams also don't need a "cluster" to be deployed, unlike Flink. They can be deployed as microservices, simplifying the deployment for less data-intensive workloads, like event-driven microservices.</P>
<P>At the same time, its tight coupling with Kafka can be a limitation for systems that don't extensively use Kafka. Compared to more comprehensive streaming solutions like Flink, Kafka Streams may lack some advanced features, particularly for complex event processing and handling large-scale data streams. It also offers limited support for non-JVM programming languages.
