<b> : </b>Kafka Streams vs. Flink</H2>
<P>In the streaming data ecosystem, <A href="https://redpanda.com/guides/kafka-tutorial"><STRONG>Apache Kafka</STRONG></A>&#174; is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting real-time data. Kafka Streams is a client library provided by Kafka for additional stream processing and transformation functions on top of Kafka.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Apache Flink&#174; is a data processing framework that can act on both data streams and batches. It has advanced processing capabilities but requires a data ingestion tool like Kafka or Redpanda for complete efficiency.</P>
<P>In this article, we compare Kafka Streams and Flink in detail. We discuss technical nuances, performance characteristics, and practical applications&#8212;providing insights into their strengths, limitations, and best use cases.
