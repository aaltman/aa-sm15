<P>Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices that transform or react to stream data. The input and output data are stored in Kafka topics. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka's server-side cluster technology for fault-tolerant, stateful stream processing.
