<P><B>Message queues </B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">are a kind of messaging-oriented middleware where producers push new messages to a named First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queue, which consumers can then pull from. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Message queues are also called </SPAN><B>point-to-point</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> messaging because there is a one-to-one relationship between a message&#8217;s producer and consumer. There can be many producers and consumers using the same queue, but any particular message will only have one producer and one consumer. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Different queue implementations will vary in how much space the queue has, whether or not messages are batched, and how long a message is kept for if it isn&#8217;t consumed.</SPAN></P>
