<b> : </b><B>3.1 Pub-sub example&nbsp;</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Many social networks already use parts of the pub-sub model and call it &#8220;following&#8221; users. Let&#8217;s look at an example to build a better intuition. Imagine a simple social network allows people to share recipes, follow their friends, and see a timeline of their friends' recipes. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">When a user shares a recipe, they can put it in a topic. One user might categorize by what meal it is, another user might categorize by the season of the ingredients. When a user follows another user, they are </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">subscribing</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> to the recipes their friend </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">publishes</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Followers can choose to see everything that&#8217;s published, or only some</SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> topics</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> that they&#8217;re interested in. Followers can also add their own </SPAN><I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">content</SPAN></I><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> filters, like excluding recipes that use certain ingredients. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Users can follow as many other users as they want, so their timeline will be full of recipes from many users, but each recipe only comes from one publishing user. Similarly, a user can be followed by many other users, and all of the followers will see a copy of the recipe on their timeline.&nbsp;</SPAN>
