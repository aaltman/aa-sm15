<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The publish-subscribe pattern, also called </SPAN><B>pub-sub, </B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">is a kind of messaging-oriented middleware that pushes a producer&#8217;s newly &#8220;published&#8221; messages based on a &#8220;subscription&#8221; of the consumer&#8217;s preferences. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">There is a one-to-many relationship between publishers and subscribers, meaning any number of subscribers can get a copy of a message, but there&#8217;s only one publisher of that message. Pub-sub doesn&#8217;t guarantee message order, just that consumers will only see messages that they&#8217;ve subscribed to. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Subscriptions can be filtered by both topic and content. Topics are any category defined by the publisher, and content is any category defined by a subscriber. It&#8217;s up to the message broker to accept and manage these filters properly.</SPAN></P>
