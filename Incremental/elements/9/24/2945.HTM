<b> : </b><B>2.1 Message queue example</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Now let&#8217;s go over a simple example of a message queue. Imagine a website that sells a high volume of T-shirts. Customers make online orders for a T-shirt and the web server produces corresponding order requests and places them on a queue for processing in the backend. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Depending on demand and availability, there could be one or several computers working to fulfill the orders. More order fulfillment servers might be needed if it&#8217;s a peak demand time of year, or if the fulfillment process for some orders is more complex.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Each order only needs to be processed once, so only one of the order fulfillment servers needs to take the order request off the queue. If for some reason multiple fulfillment servers got a copy of an order, that order would be mistakenly fulfilled multiple times. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">In summary, using a queue enables the order-taking and order-fulfilling logic to be separated, and ensures that each order will be fulfilled exactly once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>
