<P><B>Round robin </B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">is the simplest and one of the most used algorithms. The load balancer maintains a list of available servers, and routes the first request to the first server, the second request to the second server, and so on. This works well if every server in the pool has roughly the same performance characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">A &#8220;weighted&#8221; round robin takes server characteristics into account, so that servers with more resources get proportionally more of the requests. The advantages of this algorithm are that it is simple, very fast, and easy to understand. The disadvantages are that the current load of each server is not taken into account, and that the relative computation cost of each request is also not taken into account.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">A </SPAN><B>Random</B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400"> algorithm is another simple and popular approach. Requests are sent to random servers, which can be weighted by server capacity. Random works well for systems with a large number of requests because the law of large numbers means randomization will tend towards a uniform distribution. It also works well with running several LBs at the same time, because they don&#8217;t need to coordinate. </SPAN>
