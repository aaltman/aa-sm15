<b> : </b><B>2.1 Hardware vs software load balancers</B></H3>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Hardware load balancers are specialized appliances with circuitry designed to perform load balancing tasks. They are generally very performant and very expensive. Hardware LBs are generally L4 LBs, because L7 decisions are more complex and need to be updated more often.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">The most well-known and respected software load balancers are HAProxy and nginx. Software load balancers like these run on standard servers and are less hardware optimized, but cheaper to set up and run. With a software load balancer, requests are simply routed to the load balancer server instead of an application server.&nbsp;</SPAN>
