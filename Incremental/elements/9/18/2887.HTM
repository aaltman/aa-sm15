<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Load balancing algorithms are generally divided into two groups: static and dynamic. Static algorithms function the same regardless of the state of the back end serving the requests, whereas dynamic algorithms take into account the state of the backend and consider system load when routing requests.<BR><BR>Static algorithms are generally simpler and more efficient to implement but can lead to uneven distribution of requests. Dynamic algorithms are more complex and entail more overhead, as they require communication between the LB and the back-end servers, but can more efficiently distribute requests.&nbsp; </SPAN>
