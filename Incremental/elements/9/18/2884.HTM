<P><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">There are two main types of Load Balancers (LB), their names referring to layers in the OSI model of network communication. L4 LBs operate at Layer 4, the transport layer, and L7 LBs operate at Layer 7, the application layer. We&#8217;ll discuss the tradeoffs between which layer an LB operates at more in Section 2.2. </SPAN></P>
