<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">If you need to design a distributed system, think about the following 3 requirements first: scalability, availability and performance. And if data persistence is important think of durability as well. These 4 will give you and your interviewer a lot of room for discussion. If you recollect a CAP theorem, availability requirement may be replaced with consistency.</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">Remember that interviewer is your friend and you both have the same goal. Your goal is to provide as many positive data points as possible. And the interviewer&#8217;s goal is to collect as many data points as possible. In practice it means that you should start approaching any design problem with some small and simple steps. And evolve your solution with every next step. This is a win-win situation. You demonstrate progress, ability to deal with ambiguity and simplify things. While the interviewer gets all the necessary data points to bring them to the table and champion your case in the discussion with other interviewers from the interview loop.</LI></UL>
