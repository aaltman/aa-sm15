<P>Finally, API gateways manage scalability by load-balancing requests so backend servers don&#8217;t become overloaded. API gateways distribute incoming requests uniformly among several backend servers. This distribution prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck, allowing the system to scale horizontally as traffic increases. This contribution ensures the scalability and optimal performance of your APIs.&nbsp;</P>
