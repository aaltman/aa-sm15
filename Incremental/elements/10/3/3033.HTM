<P>A <EM>reverse</EM> <EM>proxy</EM> acts as an intermediary between clients and backend web services, just like forward proxies. However, reverse proxies operate on the server side, while forward proxies serve to protect clients.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Simply put, a forward proxy server resides in the client&#8217;s network, intercepts client requests, and applies policies to the requests before forwarding them to their destinations.</P>
<P>A reverse proxy server, on the other hand, sits in front of backend web services, intercepts client requests, and applies policies to the requests before forwarding them to the appropriate backend services.&nbsp;</P>
<P>A reverse proxy represents the server rather than the client. This configuration optimizes workload distribution, improves security, and uses caching to boost performance.&nbsp;</P><FIGURE class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
