<P>API gateways can employ strategies for controlling the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific time frame, enforcing <A href="https://ngrok.com/blog-post/new-feature-rate-limiting">rate limits</A> to prevent abuse, protecting backend resources, and ensuring fair usage.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Furthermore, an API gateway may delay responses to clients that have exceeded defined rate limits while prioritizing responses to clients that remain within the limits. Slower response times effectively reduce the number of requests from clients who have exceeded the rate limits. With rate limiting, increased traffic won&#8217;t disrupt the system&#8217;s overall performance.&nbsp;</P>
