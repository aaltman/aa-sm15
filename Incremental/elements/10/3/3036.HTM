<P>An API gateway excels at routing traffic and directing incoming requests from applications, devices, and other clients to the appropriate backend services or microservices. API gateways act as traffic controllers for incoming requests, appropriately examining and directing each request to its destination. An API gateway often routes based on criteria such as the requested resource's path, the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), or custom headers. For instance, in a cloud-based storage service, an API gateway efficiently routes file upload requests to servers responsible for storage and file download requests to servers designed for retrieval, ensuring optimal performance.&nbsp;</P>
