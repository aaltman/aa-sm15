<P>A reverse proxy has an active role in safeguarding and optimizing website performance in the following ways:&nbsp;</P>
<UL role=list>
<LI>Improves website security by hiding the IP addresses of the backend servers, making it more difficult for potential attackers to launch targeted DDoS attacks.</LI>
<LI>Performs load balancing by efficiently distributing incoming requests across a large number of web servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overloaded.</LI>
<LI>Caches frequently requested static content for a set time, improving response times for subsequent requests for cached content.</LI>
<LI>Performs computationally expensive TLS handshakes, which reduces stress on upstream servers and streamlines operations by limiting the number of reverse proxies to manage TLS handshakes.</LI></UL>
