<P>A forward proxy server is a software application that sits between a client&#8212;such as your computer or phone&#8212;and a server providing a resource&#8212;such as a website. You send requests to your forward proxy server, and the forward proxy server makes the request to the website on your behalf. When the website responds, it sends the response to the forward proxy server rather than directly to your device. When using a forward proxy server, all requests and responses flow through the forward proxy server&#8212;you never interact with the website directly. The forward proxy server may run on your local machine or somewhere else in your network.</P><FIGURE class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

<P>You can use forward proxy servers for many things, but one common purpose is to make things safer and more private for clients. Forward proxy servers also offer benefits like caching, anonymity, and content filtering.&nbsp;</P>
