<b> : </b><EM>Which proxy is better for my business?</EM></H3>
<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">The proxy you choose is based on what you want to protect, such as clients versus web servers, and what functions you require. If you only need to protect identities, very basic proxies are probably adequate. However, high-end proxies such as Kemp LoadMaster can come with an array of features such as application delivery, encryption management and web firewall functionality.</SPAN><BR></DIV>

<DIV>A forward proxy protects a website by making it so it doesn&#8217;t reveal its IP address or communicate directly with end users. These proxies can speed end-user responses by caching data related to popular common requests. If you care about your website performance and security, forward proxies are the answer.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Reverse proxies do the opposite, making it so end users do not communicate directly with a website or back-end servers. If you want to improve end-user response, reverse proxies (and load balancers in particular) direct end-user requests to the most available resource. They can also provide end-user security via anonymity and sometimes through encryption such as SSL.&nbsp;</DIV>
