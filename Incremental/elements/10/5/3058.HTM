<b> : </b>When to Use a Load Balancer</H3>
<P>Load balancers are typically used when you have a high <A href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/digital-marketing/search?_p_lc=1">traffic website</A> or application and you want to ensure that the traffic is evenly distributed across your servers. This not only helps to prevent any one server from being overloaded, but it also helps to ensure that your site or application remains available and responsive even during <A href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/hosting/auto-scaling?_p_lc=1">peak traffic times</A>.</P>
<P>Load balancers are also used to ensure high availability and reliability of applications. They can automatically detect a failing server and reroute traffic to other servers, minimizing <A href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/data-migration/migration-methodology?_p_lc=1">downtime</A> and disruption to users.
