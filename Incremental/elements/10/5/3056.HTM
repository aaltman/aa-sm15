<b> : </b>CDN and Load Balancer: Key Differences</H3>
<P data-spm-anchor-id="a3c0i.27947514.3143942920.i1.6b58e18dfmdTgP">The primary difference between a CDN and a load balancer lies in the problem they are designed to solve. A CDN mitigates the issue of <A href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/product/rabbitmq?_p_lc=1">latency</A> and speeds up the delivery of content to users across the globe by caching content on <A href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/product/linkiotedge?_p_lc=1" alps-track-click="27947514.3143942920.10">edge servers</A>.
