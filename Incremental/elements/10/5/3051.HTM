<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Yes. A VPN is a forward proxy. However, unlike basic forward proxies, the VPN encrypts data that is passed back and forth.&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>While a VPN has functions much like a proxy, including hiding an end-user IP address, a VPN is a more broad-based approach for providing end-user security. A VPN applies to all the sites, apps, and remote locations an end user accesses.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Proxies operate at the application level, rerouting traffic of a single browser or program. In contrast, a VPN works at the operating system level and redirects all the VPN user&#8217;s traffic through the VPN server.</DIV>
