The non-greedy DP solution to leetcode 678 valid parens with asterisk runs in O(n^3) time due to having an nxn DP table where each element takes n choices to figure out.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The non-DP solution is O(3^n) due to a branching factor of 3 when figuring out whether an asterisk counts as a left or right paren or a space.&nbsp;
