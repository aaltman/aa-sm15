The state provided its dependents &#8212; or, to use Plato&#8217;s term from the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">Republic</I>, &#8220;auxiliaries&#8221; &#8212; with basic, albeit false, securities. For a long time, people believed that this indeed was a pact, a</P>

It was assumed that the hand that took was the hand that gave as well. It is becoming more and more clear, however, that the giving part was deceitful; as long as people were provided with only the fish but not the net, they had no urge (or opportunity) to do the fishing themselves, and as long as enterprises received state subsidies, they had no motivation to earn their own profit and no opportunity (or need) to compete with others in an open market.</P>

The conscious efforts to level social status and individual achievements were successful, especially in the state sector, where outstanding work was not rewarded with higher wages or promotion and where poor performance was accepted as the average. Mediocrity became the ideal. Homogenization worked.</P>

Opportunities have multiplied not only for businesses but for practically everyone skilled in some profession. The market for skills has become most complex, and the person with outstanding talent, perfor- mance, or vision can be competitive.</P>

One sees Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars on Hungarian roads, and travel agencies can do good business by taking their clients to the Bahamas or Bermuda. The new possibilities for some Hungarians to &#8220;make it&#8221; frustrate many of their already bitter and depressed compatriots, especially those who are very dependent on the state. These first signs of affluence seem to have disappointed those who could not enjoy such new plea- sures. A special kind of envy is widespread; many do not want to see anyone succeed. People still think in terms of a zero-sum game, as they did during communist days: one person&#8217;s gain is another person&#8217;s loss. It is a world exemplified by the joke &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a Western European farmer and</P>

There are two important scenarios here. In the scenario of dependency, the potential East European businessman backs away from going into business. This is the real stumbling block. As the late Rita Klimova, the Czech Ambassador to the U.S., said, &#8220;What can you tell a person in Central and Eastern Europe who, for the first time in his life, pictures the possibility that he might even<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">lose<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>the money he plans to invest in his business?&#8221; Without the tradition of individualism, without the models of self-reliance and &#8220;the different drummer&#8221; as ideals of autonomous living, it is very difficult to spread market values in Central and Eastern Europe. In this particular instance, this per- son weighs the advantages of winning against those of losing (both in the realm of the unfamiliar), then looks at his life as he knows it (in the realm of the familiar), and decides to stay with the modest but familiar lifestyle.</P>
<P style='FONT-SIZE: 11pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5pt; MARGIN: 0pt; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt'>In the second scenario the businessman is successful. Soon, however, he is sobered by the manifestations of envy &#8212; his car is vandalized in the middle of the night, his children are humili- ated at school, and stories of corruption and adultery are circu- lated about him. No Protestant ethic of deserved wealth comes to his rescue. In this situation, the rich, instead of fulfilling new responsibilities to help the poor and pursue all kinds of philan- thropic activities (like sponsoring the arts) to the benefit of soci- ety, will often hide and cover up their success. In reality, this culture of envy has actually kept him from sharing the fruits of his labor with those in need. In the end, society has been left empty-handed.</P></LI>
