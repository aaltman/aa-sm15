But these mentalities were not born during the communist decades, when conscious efforts were made to cut off the past. Communism taught Hun- garians a strange relationship to history. Generations grew up with the belief that a new era began with the communists. &#8220;B.C.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;before communism&#8221;&#8212; times were sometimes given a distorted narrative.</P>

Thus, a soft version of dictatorship was invented. In return for benefits unparalleled in Central and Eastern Europe, Hungarians became K&#225;d&#225;r&#8217;s accomplices in the common effort to live better. K&#225;d&#225;r&#8217;s political gesture was the significant wink. &#8220;Let us not provoke Moscow&#8217;s anger: promise me that no more &#8216;fifty-sixes will occur, and, in exchange, I will make you the star country on the block,&#8221; the wink said. They soon became party to the deal. Society was self-contained, excesses were curbed, cen- sorship was self-imposed. Journalists and historians went along with never referring to the &#8220;events&#8221; of 1956 or the lives of Hun- garian minorities in the neighboring &#8220;brotherly&#8221; countries. Tele- vision commentators enthusiastically condemned Israel&#8217;s &#8220;aggression&#8221; in 1967. These same reporters spoke about broth- erly help to the &#8220;Czechoslovak people&#8221; in 1968 and to the Afghan people in 1981.</P>

The soft eiderdown of a more permissive totalitari- anism. Party membership was not forced: only about every sixth person of the wage-earning population was a cardholding mem- ber of the Communist Party (800,000 out of a population of 10 million). Travel was liberalized: every third year, Hungarians were allowed to travel to the West (unless their passports were refused) and exchange currency, from $70 in the 1970s to $300 in the 1980s.

I would like to make it clear that communism bred societies that were &#8212; and still are &#8212; significantly more materialistic than their Western counterparts. Material posses- sions are proportionately more valued in these countries and, therefore, can be used as bargaining chips to a greater extent than in Western democracies.</P>

People who must dedicate much of their energy to satisfying their daily physical needs cannot be expected to pursue higher self-actual- izing goals. Foreign visitors to Eastern and Central Europe will probably agree when I say that mere existence requires a much more constant effort than in Western countries. There are two reasons for this. One, the buying power of an average Hungar- ian salary is less than one-tenth of the U.S. average. This Hun- garian salary pays for about fifteen times fewer loaves of bread, gallons of gasoline, square feet of real estate, and automobiles, thus leaving very little for &#8220;extras.&#8221; In fact, 85 to 90 percent of the average Hungarian family income has to be spent on gro- ceries, housing, and utilities. The second reason is harder to grasp but is related to the underdeveloped nature of infrastruc- ture and services. The practical maintenance of an everyday rou- tine seems to be the chief goal of life in Eastern Europe, rather than being subordinate to other activities or a &#8220;higher&#8221; objec- tive. Abraham H. Maslow&#8217;s pyramid may provide an explana- tion: According to Maslow&#8217;s theory of human motivation, one&#8217;s basic needs for food and shelter represent the base of the pyra- mid. At the top of the pyramid are one&#8217;s needs for self-respect and self-actualization. However, only<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">after<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>the lower physical needs, as well as the need for love and security, are satisfied can</P>

With Hungarian technological levels low, people remained &#8212; out of necessity &#8212; at the base of Maslow&#8217;s pyramid.</P>

Latin Americanization occurs when a thin layer of society becomes very rich, while the rest of society is lagging behind. It has clear economic, political, and cultural causes and effects. The phenomenon of Latin Americanization can best be understood by analyzing the new economic elite ris- ing in the CEE countries. Where do they come from? Where did they find the initial capital (in the late 1980s and early 1990s) in these generally capital-poor economies? Political scientists and sociologists have shown clearly that in Poland, Hungary, and Russia, especially, the former communists have been the chief financial beneficiaries of the economic reforms. British political scientist Anne Applebaum talks of the revival of the old Italian model in Central Europe, which was composed of &#8220;corrupt regimes led by former communist parties that rely on a semi- mafia business class composed mostly of former communists.&#8221; Applebaum continues, &#8220;Links between ex-<I style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">nomenklatura<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></I>capital- ists and ex-communist politicians remain intact... creating a rul- ing class that holds power in several fields, with little room for real competition in political or economic debates.&#8221;<SPAN class=s14 style='FONT-SIZE: 5.5pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px'>8</SPAN></P>

Under such conditions, it is very difficult for those who fall out- side this oligarchic network to be competitive. Other develop- ments seem also to run counter to market competition. The taking back of the administration in Hungary by ex-communists through purges and sweeping personnel changes fits into this trend as well. Applebaum writes of the stultifying effect lack of competition has on politics and economy; it also goes counter to the kind of capitalism and political openness Hungary&#8217;s pro- gressive forces chose. The Copenhagen Document of the Confer- ence on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), for example, states that &#8220;the representative nature of government must also be reflected in the administration, through equal access of all citizens to political and public office.&#8221; There are ministries in Hungary in which most of those hired between 1990 and 1994 have been dismissed. In many cases the political motivation of these purges is clear. Depriving citizens of equal access to administrative offices sends a negative signal &#8212; both inside and outside of the country. Externally, it speaks about Hungary hovering between the cultures of Eastern and Western Europe; internally, it creates an atmosphere of fear not con- ducive to democracy.</P>
