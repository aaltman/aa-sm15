If you are using the legacy <SPAN class=notranslate>FCM</SPAN> send APIs, we strongly recommend that you <A href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">migrate to the HTTP v1 API</A> or consider using the <A href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server#choosing-a-server-option">Admin SDK</A> to build send requests.</SPAN></ASIDE> 
<P>We limit the rate that you can connect to FCM XMPP servers to 400 connections per minute per project. This shouldn't be an issue for message delivery, but it is important for ensuring the stability of the system. For each project, FCM allows 2500 connections in parallel.</P>
<P>For upstream messaging with XMPP, FCM limits <A href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/upstream">upstream messages</A> at 1,500,000/minute per project to avoid overloading upstream destination servers.</P>
<P>We limit upstream messages per device at 1,000/minute to protect against battery drain from bad app behavior.
