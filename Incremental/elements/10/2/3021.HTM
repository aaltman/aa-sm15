<P>Message fanout is the process of sending a message to multiple devices, such as when you target topics and groups, or when you use the <A href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/notification">Notifications composer</A> to target audiences or user segments.</P>
<P>Message fanout is not instantaneous and so occasionally you have multiple fanouts in progress concurrently. We limit the number of concurrent message fanouts per project to 1,000. After that, we may reject additional fanout requests or defer the fanout of the requests until some of the already in progress fanouts complete.</P>
<P>The actual achievable fanout rate is influenced by the number of projects requesting fanouts at the same time. A fanout rate of 10,000 QPS for an individual project is not uncommon, but that number is not a guarantee and is a result of the total load on the system. It is important to note that the available fanout capacity is divided among projects and not across fanout requests. So, if your project has two fanouts in progress, then each fanout will only see half of the available fanout rate. The recommended way to maximize your fanout speed is to only have one active fanout in progress at a time.
