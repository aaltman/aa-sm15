It performs the function of a reverse proxy by accepting all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregating the different services needed to fulfill them, and returning the right outcome. <STRONG class="mh gu">User authentication, rate limits, and statistics</STRONG> are typical duties that API gateways take care of on behalf of a system of API services. Also, the API gateway can handle faults (circuit breaker) and log and monitor.</LI>

Usually, we have two or more web servers on the backend, and it distributes network traffic between them. Its primary purpose is to use resources optimally. Equal task allocation and increased capacity can enhance the system&#8217;s responsiveness and reliability. There are three high-level load balancers: hardware-based, cloud-based, and software-based.</LI>

Reverse proxies are typically used to increase security, speed, and dependability. A reverse proxy receives a request from a client, forwards it to another server, and then returns it to the client, giving the impression that the first proxy server handled the request. These proxies ensure that users don&#8217;t access the origin server directly, giving the web server anonymity. They are usually used for Load balancing, where we need to deal with incoming traffic flow so that we may distribute that traffic between multiple backend servers or use them for caching.</LI></UL>
