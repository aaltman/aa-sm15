The last Soviet troops left in 1991, making it possible to put Hungary&#8217;s relations with Russia and the Ukraine on a new footing. The country was obviously advancing toward European Union membership. Hungary&#8217;s good international standing trickled down, we might say, to the ordinary citizen as well, who now does not need a visa to visit any European country, not even Israel (in which case Hungary was again the first).

Hungarian politicians could afford to think long- term, with the future as a priority, for which the hardships of the present might be justly traded. This is the vision that put emphasis on infrastructure, education, and telecommunication. Socially, Hungary was praised for its stability: in spite of the hardships, Hungarians pulled through without significant social unrest. Most Hungarians liked the fact that, unlike in some other countries, no &#8220;decommunization&#8221; (purging of former commu- nists) occurred, even though the majority of Hungary&#8217;s 1990 &#8211; 94 Parliament was noncommunist and though the members of gov- ernment were all pro-Western professionals.</FONT></P>

People who must dedicate much of their energy to satisfying their daily physical needs cannot be expected to pursue higher self-actual- izing goals. Foreign visitors to Eastern and Central Europe will probably agree when I say that mere existence requires a much more constant effort than in Western countries. There are two reasons for this. One, the buying power of an average Hungar- ian salary is less than one-tenth of the U.S. average. This Hun- garian salary pays for about fifteen times fewer loaves of bread, gallons of gasoline, square feet of real estate, and automobiles, thus leaving very little for &#8220;extras.&#8221; In fact, 85 to 90 percent of the average Hungarian family income has to be spent on gro- ceries, housing, and utilities. The second reason is harder to grasp but is related to the underdeveloped nature of infrastruc- ture and services. The practical maintenance of an everyday rou- tine seems to be the chief goal of life in Eastern Europe, rather than being subordinate to other activities or a &#8220;higher&#8221; objec- tive.

The phenomenon of Latin Americanization can best be understood by analyzing the new economic elite ris- ing in the CEE countries. Where do they come from? Where did they find the initial capital (in the late 1980s and early 1990s) in these generally capital-poor economies? Political scientists and sociologists have shown clearly that in Poland, Hungary, and Russia, especially, the former communists have been the chief financial beneficiaries of the economic reforms.

Under such conditions, it is very difficult for those who fall out- side this oligarchic network to be competitive. Other develop- ments seem also to run counter to market competition. The taking back of the administration in Hungary by ex-communists through purges and sweeping personnel changes fits into this trend as well. Applebaum writes of the stultifying effect lack of competition has on politics and economy; it also goes counter to the kind of capitalism and political openness Hungary&#8217;s pro- gressive forces chose. The Copenhagen Document of the Confer- ence on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), for example, states that &#8220;the representative nature of government must also be reflected in the administration, through equal access of all citizens to political and public office.&#8221; There are ministries in Hungary in which most of those hired between 1990 and 1994 have been dismissed. In many cases the political motivation of these purges is clear. Depriving citizens of equal access to administrative offices sends a negative signal &#8212; both inside and outside of the country. Externally, it speaks about Hungary hovering between the cultures of Eastern and Western Europe; internally, it creates an atmosphere of fear not con- ducive to democracy.</FONT></P>

The world of the mind was considered the gravest threat to the communists, one to be controlled by all means. Among such conditions, writing performed a distorted function: to say indi- rectly that which could not be said directly. Literature, as well as scholarship, became politicized; in a sense, this function made literature less &#8220;literary.&#8221; The good writer was expected to be the &#8220;conscience&#8221; of the nation, a person of moral courage.</FONT></P>

In spite of the supposed open-mindedness of the Hungarian communists, the cultural commissars maintained a firm grip on what people could read, write, say, and think. My own personal experience was that this grip had hardly eased even by the 1980s. Upon returning from a trip to New York, my copies of books by Solzhenitsyn, Churchill, and Betty Friedan were equally confiscated. Book- stores and libraries, even the best academic university libraries, also carried only those books permitted and tolerated by the cul- tural commissars. Naturally, only these commissars could give the green light to what books were to be translated and pub- lished by the state-owned publishing houses, which were intri- cately overseen by censors of many kinds.</FONT></P>

Or, at a time when German was commonly spoken by the educated classes of Hungary, Freud and Jung were immediately translated for the general public in the first decades of the century. The few democratic years after World War II saw a boom in publication of translations as well; people were starved to read what they were not permitted dur- ing the war, so Walter Lippmann, Wendell Willkie, Andr&#233; Mau- rois, George Marshall, Stephen Vincent Ben&#233;t, and Henry Steele Commager were immediately translated. This intellectual &#8220;gusto&#8221; is especially striking if one considers the starvation&#8212;or, at best, &#8220;diet&#8221; &#8212; that was to come again in the next several decades. Following the communist takeover of 1948, Hungary lost its tradition of keeping its book market up-to-date with European and other readings. The generations that grew up between 1948 and the mid- to late 1980s found themselves sealed off from most of the intellectual currents of Europe and the United States.</FONT></P>

It was a sobering antagonism: the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe were committed to dismantling communism, yet signals of encour- agement were lagging behind. But the disappointment of Cen- tral Europeans in the West culminated after the euphoria of 1989 &#8211; 90 was over. This is the time labeled by Tsvetan Todorov, the Bulgarian-born structuralist, as &#8220;post-totalitarian depres- sion,&#8221; a feeling of letdown experienced by Central and East Europeans after realizing that the West was not supporting them as enthusiastically as they had hoped.</FONT></P>

For many in the West, it looked &#8212; and perhaps still looks &#8212; much more comfortable to have Eastern Europe con- tained and by itself. The political systems in Hungary&#8212;and, to a lesser degree, in most other Central and East European coun- tries &#8212; were, by this time, already quite far from Stalinism. Hun- garian communism had a &#8220;human face&#8221;: it was not aggressive, growing less and less proud of its accomplishments, and humil- iating the individual less and less frequently. Besides, this self- disciplined authoritarian system controlled itself: the Western world was not threatened by having to admit refugees and guest workers or by local conflicts awaiting solution. Because the communist countries closed the fences on themselves, they did not challenge the conscience of the West either.</FONT></P>
