Hungary was, for example, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to be admitted into various organizations of European integration such as the Council of Europe. The last Soviet troops left in 1991, making it possible to put Hungary&#8217;s relations with Russia and the Ukraine on a new footing. The country was obviously advancing toward European Union membership. Hungary&#8217;s good international standing trickled down, we might say, to the ordinary citizen as well, who now does not need a visa to visit any European country, not even Israel (in which case Hungary was again the first). The world appreciated the security and sta- bility inside the country, as well as the peace that had to be maintained every day along the 300-kilometer stretch of the southeastern border with the former Yugoslavia.</P>

Many of the state-owned enter- prises were dismantled; privatization was conducted gradually but with full vigor. Unemployment, at 12 percent, seemed high but was still less than in some of the more developed countries, such as France. Hungarian politicians could afford to think long- term, with the future as a priority, for which the hardships of the present might be justly traded. This is the vision that put emphasis on infrastructure, education, and telecommunication. Socially, Hungary was praised for its stability: in spite of the hardships, Hungarians pulled through without significant social unrest. Most Hungarians liked the fact that, unlike in some other countries, no &#8220;decommunization&#8221; (purging of former commu- nists) occurred, even though the majority of Hungary&#8217;s 1990 &#8211; 94 Parliament was noncommunist and though the members of gov- ernment were all pro-Western professionals.</P>

The poll revealed extremely disturbing facts about the attitude of voters toward the market reforms introduced during the previous four years. Clearly, supporters of the winning Socialist Party were most opposed to a free market economy and the predominance of private prop- erty and were the most nostalgic for government redistribution of income. These were the voters who brought the Socialist Party to victory; they clearly said no to much that had happened</P>

People, with their nostalgic votes, articulated their preference for illu- sion rather than reality: they were nostalgic for the 1970s and 1980s, when foreign loans (originally taken for infrastructural investments but actually spent on consumer goods as well as gigantic, wasteful, and harmful projects like the Danube Dam) granted higher living standards than Hungary&#8217;s real economic output would have allowed. For decades, Hungary, under com- munist leadership, was, in the words of Hungarian-born Har- vard economist J&#225;nos Kornai, eating up its tomorrow and thus &#8220;discounting its future.&#8221;<SPAN class=s14 style='FONT-SIZE: 5.5pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px'>6<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN>Indeed, it was a short-term vision, its priority lying only in the present.

In this amusing opera, otherwise full of self-criticism, the &#8220;Hungarian-Russian&#8221; border divides two contrasting worlds of good and bad, of eter- nal summer and everlasting winter. I often think that Hungari- ans &#8212; who took their comparatively higher living standards for granted &#8212; believed that such a contrast between Hungary and the other countries of the region justifiably existed not only in fairy tales and comic operas. The population&#8217;s &#8220;fairytale&#8221; per- ception of Hungary, maintained by the illusory policies of the 1970s and &#8217;80s, was shattered during the unexpected hardships and difficulties of the country&#8217;s transition, leaving Hungarians disappointed with the current state of affairs.</P></LI>
