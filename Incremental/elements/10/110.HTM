They refuse to be spoon-fed another promise of a bright future. But pessimism and optimism are relative terms. Imagine two people inspecting a vineyard after a devastating early frost. One of them is gloomy about the harvest. The other is filled with joy over the signs of life he finds in spite of the frost. Is one the pes- simist, the other the optimist? While they both see the same vineyard, their assessments are different depending upon how they view the predictable (or whether they base their expecta- tions on reality at all). Hungary&#8217;s vineyard is devastated no mat- ter how we look at it. Forty years of wasteful economic practices and political mismanagement cannot be easily undone. To those suffering in the period of political and economic changes, democracy and market economy have become increasingly equated with poverty.</P>

Only a select few were in the know about how political decisions were reached in the Politb&#252;ro or the Central Committee, how much certain industries received in state subsidies, how much the national debt amounted to, or how many people had escaped from the country throughout the years. Political education covered the &#8220;History of the Workers&#8217; Movement&#8221; but taught nothing about how democracies or their own societies really functioned. Whole scholarly fields were missing from the curricula of Political Science and Economics departments in universities. &#8220;No wonder,&#8221; political scientists remark today, with a certain self-criticism. &#8220;Formerly all were Marxist; today all proclaim themselves liberal.&#8221;<SPAN class=s14 style='FONT-SIZE: 5.5pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px'>11</SPAN></P>

According to another poll conducted in March 1995 by the Hungarian public opinion firm Sonda Ipsos, the percentage of Hungarians who consider democratic values such as freedom of expression and freedom of the press important is alarmingly low &#8212; 6 percent and decreasing.</P>

Hungarians have very little idea of the mechanisms of democracies; they are taught no such subject as Government or Citizenship. Another poll conducted by a U.S. firm investi- gated how the average Hungarian citizen reacted to the princi- ples of democracy, a free parliamentary system, and a free market economy. &#8220;As they watch politicians debate legislation,&#8221; says Daniel Odescalchi, the author of the poll,</P>

For the past forty-five years they were accustomed to a one-party system. Par- liament was just a rubber stamp, a theater created to give the impression of self-rule to Hungarians. In Parliament, MPs would fall in place according to rank and file. It was unheard of to debate or &#8220;argue&#8221; among themselves. Today, as in any multi- party political environment, the politician in Hungary debates issues and, for the most part, votes along party lines. How does the Hungarian citizen view this? Certainly not like we do in mature democracies. Here in Hungary, this healthy exchange of ideas symbolizes &#8220;chaos.&#8221; They feel that &#8220;the government has lost control&#8221; and &#8220;the country is falling apart.&#8221; Hungarians remember back to when the government was &#8220;in order&#8221; and blame the present parties for this &#8220;confusion.&#8221; Initial research showed that there is a segment of the population that hopes the old guard would get a large enough percentage of the vote so that they would not need a coalition partner to govern. These people said that a coalition partner would only &#8220;interfere with the work&#8221; and &#8220;argue, impede getting things done.&#8221; Although this is a smaller segment of the population, we see the one party system, because of its simplicity, makes more sense to them.<SPAN class=s17 style='FONT-SIZE: 5pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 3pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px'>12</SPAN></P>

Hungary is on the borderline of two geopolitical regions that differ, for one, according to how politi- cal and social disagreements are solved. Risking generalization, I would argue that west of the border, disagreements are solved by negotiation and compromise, but east of it the immediate instinct is conflict and violence.

The still unresolved problems among the nations, especially the eth- nic ones, can be explained in part by the inability to understand and empathize with the problems of others.</P>

The same society today reacts to markets, influences politics and is having to deal with the unplanned collapse of the only system which it knew,&#8221; writes Odescalchi. &#8220;One politician compared the people&#8217;s reaction to that of a tiger who grew up in captivity. When his cage is placed in the wild and the gate is opened, the tiger will stick his head out, look around and then sit down in the doorway. In 1990, Hungarians opened the gate when they voted against communism. Now they have sat down in the doorway.&#8221;<SPAN class=s14 style='FONT-SIZE: 5.5pt; TEXT-DECORATION: none; FONT-FAMILY: "Book Antiqua", serif; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; COLOR: black; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-STYLE: normal; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px'>13</SPAN></P></LI>
