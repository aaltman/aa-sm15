<P>Navigating between API gateways and reverse proxies can be confusing because there is some overlap in features. In fact, <FONT class=extract>API gateways are technically a specialized type of reverse proxy</FONT>. However, an API gateway is a distinct tool designed for different roles than a pure reverse proxy.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let's investigate the difference between an API gateway and a reverse proxy.&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>An API gateway manages API requests and serves as an entry point for clients. It offers various API management functionalities&#8212;including routing, security, load balancing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and other API-specific tasks. It&#8217;s ideal for exposing and managing APIs to external clients, including third-party developers, mobile apps, and web applications.</FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A reverse proxy, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary between clients and servers, forwarding client requests to appropriate backend servers and returning responses to clients. It primarily focuses on load balancing, caching, TLS termination, and shielding backend servers from direct exposure to the internet. It&#8217;s commonly used for web applications, websites, and internal services, especially where the objective is to distribute client requests among multiple backend servers.&nbsp;</P>
