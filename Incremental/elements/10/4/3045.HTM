<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Reverse proxies have the same basic functions or underpinnings, but there are several distinct types.</SPAN><BR></DIV>

<P>Some reverse proxies are basic intermediaries, sitting between users and a web server and obscuring the IP addresses. Others have deeper functions such as load balancing and firewall services. The best, such as Kemp LoadMaster, have a bevy of features.</P>

<LI><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto"><STRONG>Load Balancers:</STRONG> A <A href="https://kemptechnologies.com/what-is-load-balancing" target=_blank>load balancer</A> can be deployed as software or hardware to a device that distributes connections from clients between a set of servers. A load balancer acts as a &#8216;reverse-proxy&#8217; to represent the application servers to the client through a virtual IP address (VIP). This technology is known as server load balancing (SLB). SLB is designed for pools of application servers within a single site or local area network (LAN).<BR></SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>Application Delivery Controllers: </STRONG>An Application Delivery Controller (ADC), sometimes referred to as a load balancer, is a network server that takes processor-intensive tasks off the web servers so they can focus on application tasks. ADC is a core component of an Application Delivery Network, which is made of a suite of technologies deployed in concert to deliver applications efficiently over a network.<BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Encryption Servers:</STRONG> Here, the proxy includes encryption services such as TSL and certificate management.<BR></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Caching Servers:</STRONG> These servers are designed mainly to speed web performance by caching frequently accessed content.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Content Delivery Networks (CDN): </STRONG>These networks, designed for high-traffic websites, cache traffic to locations closer to the end users for quicker content delivery and have data centers spread across geographies to hold this content.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Web Application Firewall:</STRONG> A Web Application Firewall (WAF) builds on and enhances traditional firewall security protection. Traditional firewalls don't stop encrypted HTTPS traffic as they have no visibility of the content within. A Web Application Firewall, which is logically placed between standard firewalls and web servers, operates at Layer 7 of the network stack. It can decrypt HTTPS traffic and inspect the data content. In conjunction with lists of known attack methods, the Web Application Firewall can deny access to web servers when it detects malicious activity.&nbsp;</LI></UL></DIV>
