<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">A reverse proxy tends to be a simpler approach in which the proxy gets a request from a client, passes it onto a server to be processed and then sends the server&#8217;s response to the client making the request.</SPAN><BR></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Reverse proxies present a layer of abstraction between the client and the server&#8212;thus the term proxy. This way a hacker doesn&#8217;t directly interact with the server and can&#8217;t launch successful attacks such as DDoS.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>In contrast, a load balancer takes client requests and distributes them amongst a defined group of servers, and, in that process, the server best suited for the request handles the processing and sends the response back to the client. Often this is the server with the least load which means it can process the request the fastest and not load an already heavily used server.</DIV>

<DIV><STRONG>A load balancer is a reverse proxy</STRONG>. It presents a virtual IP address (VIP) representing the application to the client. The client connects to the VIP and <A href="https://kemptechnologies.com/fr/load-balancer/load-balancing-algorithms-techniques" target=_blank>the load balancer makes a determination through its algorithms</A> to send the connection to a specific application instance on a server. The load balancer continues to manage and monitor the connection for the entire duration.</DIV>
