<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Reverse proxies have the same basic functions or underpinnings, but there are several distinct types.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<P><FONT class=extract>Some reverse proxies are basic intermediaries, sitting between users and a web server and obscuring the IP addresses. Others have deeper functions such as load balancing and firewall services. The best, such as Kemp LoadMaster, have a bevy of features.</FONT></P>

A load balancer acts as a &#8216;reverse-proxy&#8217; to represent the application servers to the client through a virtual IP address (VIP). This technology is known as server load balancing (SLB). SLB is designed for pools of application servers within a single site or local area network (LAN).<BR></FONT></SPAN>

ADC is a core component of an Application Delivery Network, which is made of a suite of technologies deployed in concert to deliver applications efficiently over a network.<BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Encryption Servers:</STRONG> Here, the proxy includes encryption services such as TSL and certificate management.<BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Caching Servers:</STRONG> These servers are designed mainly to speed web performance by caching frequently accessed content. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Content Delivery Networks (CDN): </STRONG>These networks, designed for high-traffic websites, cache traffic to locations closer to the end users for quicker content delivery and have data centers spread across geographies to hold this content. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract><STRONG>Web Application Firewall:</STRONG> A Web Application Firewall (WAF) builds on and enhances traditional firewall security protection. Traditional firewalls don't stop encrypted HTTPS traffic as they have no visibility of the content within. A Web Application Firewall, which is logically placed between standard firewalls and web servers, operates at Layer 7 of the network stack. It can decrypt HTTPS traffic and inspect the data content. In conjunction with lists of known attack methods, the Web Application Firewall can deny access to web servers when it detects malicious activity.&nbsp;</FONT></LI></UL></DIV>
<H2><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">What is the Difference Between a Load Balancer and Reverse Proxy?</SPAN><BR></FONT></H2>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">A reverse proxy tends to be a simpler approach in which the proxy gets a request from a client, passes it onto a server to be processed and then sends the server&#8217;s response to the client making the request.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>Reverse proxies present a layer of abstraction between the client and the server&#8212;thus the term proxy. This way a hacker doesn&#8217;t directly interact with the server and can&#8217;t launch successful attacks such as DDoS.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>In contrast, a load balancer takes client requests and distributes them amongst a defined group of servers, and, in that process, the server best suited for the request handles the processing and sends the response back to the client. Often this is the server with the least load which means it can process the request the fastest and not load an already heavily used server.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><STRONG>A load balancer is a reverse proxy</STRONG>. It presents a virtual IP address (VIP) representing the application to the client. The client connects to the VIP and </FONT><A href="https://kemptechnologies.com/fr/load-balancer/load-balancing-algorithms-techniques" target=_blank><FONT class=extract>the load balancer makes a determination through its algorithms</FONT></A><FONT class=extract> to send the connection to a specific application instance on a server. The load balancer continues to manage and monitor the connection for the entire duration.</FONT></DIV>

<H2><FONT class=extract>What Does a Load Balancer Do?</FONT></H2>
<H3><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto"><EM>Application Workloads/Servers</EM></SPAN><BR></FONT></H3>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Load balancers provide availability and scalability to the application. The application can scale beyond the capacity of a single server. The load balancer works to steer the traffic to a pool of available servers through various load-balancing algorithms. If you require more resources, you can add additional servers.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<H3><EM><FONT class=extract>Availability</FONT></EM></H3>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Load balancers health check the application on the server to determine its availability. If the health check fails, the load balancer takes that instance of the application out of its pool of available servers. When the application comes back online, the health check validates its availability, and the server is put back into the availability pool.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>

<H2><FONT class=extract>Proxy 101: Three Frequently Asked Questions</FONT></H2>
<H3><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto"><EM>Is VPN a forward proxy?</EM></SPAN><BR></FONT></H3>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Yes. A VPN is a forward proxy. However, unlike basic forward proxies, the VPN encrypts data that is passed back and forth.&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>While a VPN has functions much like a proxy, including hiding an end-user IP address, a VPN is a more broad-based approach for providing end-user security. A VPN applies to all the sites, apps, and remote locations an end user accesses.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>Proxies operate at the application level, rerouting traffic of a single browser or program. In contrast, a VPN works at the operating system level and redirects all the VPN user&#8217;s traffic through the VPN server.</FONT></DIV>

<H3><EM><FONT class=extract>What is DNS forwarding proxy?</FONT></EM></H3>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">A DNS proxy can forward both requests and replies between DNS clients and a DNS server. This provides faster DNS response and reduces network latency. Perhaps more critical, DNS forwarding via a proxy protects DNS addresses and protects them from malicious actors.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>With DNS forwarding, a DNS request is forwarded from one DNS server to a different server, such as forwarding internal DNS server requests to a DNS server at an internet service provider.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<H3><EM><FONT class=extract>Which proxy is better for my business?</FONT></EM></H3>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">The proxy you choose is based on what you want to protect, such as clients versus web servers, and what functions you require. If you only need to protect identities, very basic proxies are probably adequate. However, high-end proxies such as Kemp LoadMaster can come with an array of features such as application delivery, encryption management and web firewall functionality.</SPAN><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>A forward proxy protects a website by making it so it doesn&#8217;t reveal its IP address or communicate directly with end users. These proxies can speed end-user responses by caching data related to popular common requests. If you care about your website performance and security, forward proxies are the answer.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract>Reverse proxies do the opposite, making it so end users do not communicate directly with a website or back-end servers. If you want to improve end-user response, reverse proxies (and load balancers in particular) direct end-user requests to the most available resource. They can also provide end-user security via anonymity and sometimes through encryption such as SSL.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT class=extract><BR></FONT></DIV>
<H3><EM><FONT class=extract>Can a forward proxy act as a reverse proxy?</FONT></EM></H3>
<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto"><FONT class=extract>A forward proxy server cannot act as a reverse proxy server, as the two proxy types have exactly opposite purposes.&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN></DIV>
