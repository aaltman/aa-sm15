<DIV><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: inherit; WORD-SPACING: normal; caret-color: auto">Load balancers health check the application on the server to determine its availability. If the health check fails, the load balancer takes that instance of the application out of its pool of available servers. When the application comes back online, the health check validates its availability, and the server is put back into the availability pool.</SPAN><BR></DIV>
