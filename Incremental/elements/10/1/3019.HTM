<b> : </b><SPAN role=heading aria-level=4 class=devsite-heading>Requesting a quota increase</SPAN></H4>
<P>Before requesting a quota increase, ensure that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Your usage is regularly &#8805; 80% of quota for at least 5 consecutive minutes per day.</LI>
<LI>You have &lt; 5% client error ratio, especially during peak traffic.</LI>
<LI>You adhere to the best practices for sending <A href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/scale-fcm">messages at scale</A>.</LI></UL>
<P>If you meet these criteria, you can <A href="https://firebase.google.com/support/troubleshooter/contact">submit a quota increase request</A> for up to +25% and <SPAN class=notranslate>FCM</SPAN> will make every practical effort to fulfill the request (no increase can be guaranteed).</P>
<P>If you need more downstream messaging quota due to an impending launch or temporary event, request your quota at least 15 days in advance to allow sufficient time to handle the request. For large requests (&gt;18M messages per minute), at least 30 days of notice is required. Launches and special event requests are still subject to the client error ratio and best practices requirements.</P>
