Fifth, <SPAN style='BOX-SIZING: border-box; FONT-FAMILY: "Open Sans"'><STRONG style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased">atomic RMW operations have some fixed associated costs</STRONG></SPAN>. For modern Intel x86 processors cost of a single atomic RMW operation (LOCK prefixed instruction) is some 40 cycles (depends on a particular model, and steadily decreases). The cost comes mostly from frequently-unneeded embed full memory fence (so when Intel will separate atomicity and memory ordering, you may cross out this rule). However, the cost is fixed and does not affect scalability, so is far less important than above-outlined scalability-affecting points. Of course, all well-known single-threaded optimization rules are still applicable too. So we may include into the fifth point also algorithmic optimality and general implementation quality.
