<b> : </b>Our Development Environment</H1>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Development velocity is very important to Google, so we&#8217;ve built a complete development environment to make use of our infrastructure<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Mor12b" data-type="xref">[Mor12b]</A>.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Apart from a few groups that have their own open source repositories (e.g., Android and Chrome), Google Software Engineers work from a single shared repository<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Pot16" data-type="xref">[Pot16]</A>. This has a few important practical implications for our workflows:</P>

<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">If engineers encounter a problem in a component outside of their project, they can fix the problem, send the proposed changes ("changelist," or<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">CL</EM>) to the owner for review, and submit the CL to the mainline.</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Changes to source code in an engineer&#8217;s own project require a review. All software is reviewed before being submitted.</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">When software is built, the build request is sent to build servers in a datacenter. Even large builds are executed quickly, as many build servers can compile in parallel. This infrastructure is also used for continuous testing. Each time a CL is submitted, tests run on all software that may depend on that CL, either directly or indirectly. If the framework determines that the change likely broke other parts in the system, it notifies the owner of the submitted change. Some projects use a push-on-green system, where a new version is automatically pushed to production after passing tests.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=xref_production-environment_shakespeare style="FONT-SIZE: 18px; FONT-FAMILY: Roboto; WHITE-SPACE: normal; WORD-SPACING: 0px; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; FONT-WEIGHT: 400; COLOR: rgb(81,81,84); FONT-STYLE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; WIDOWS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255); TEXT-INDENT: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial" data-type="sect1">
