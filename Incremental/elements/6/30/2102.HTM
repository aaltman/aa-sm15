<b> : </b>Measuring Service Risk</H1>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">As standard practice at Google, we are often best served by identifying an objective metric to represent the property of a system we want to optimize. By setting a target, we can assess our current performance and track improvements or degradations over time. For service risk, it is not immediately clear how to reduce all of the potential factors into a single metric. Service failures can have many potential effects, including user dissatisfaction, harm, or loss of trust; direct or indirect revenue loss; brand or reputational impact; and undesirable press coverage. Clearly, some of these factors are very hard to measure. To make this problem tractable and consistent across many types of systems we run, we focus on<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">unplanned downtime</EM>.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">For most services, the most straightforward way of representing risk tolerance is in terms of the acceptable level of unplanned downtime. Unplanned downtime is captured by the desired level of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">service availability</EM>, usually expressed in terms of the number of "nines" we would like to provide: 99.9%, 99.99%, or 99.999% availability. Each additional nine corresponds to an order of magnitude improvement toward 100% availability. For serving systems, this metric is traditionally calculated based on the proportion of system uptime (see<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/#risk-management_measuring-service-risk_time-availability-equation" data-type="xref">Time-based availability</A>).</P>
