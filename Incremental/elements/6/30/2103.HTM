<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Using this formula over the period of a year, we can calculate the acceptable number of minutes of downtime to reach a given number of nines of availability. For example, a system with an availability target of 99.99% can be down for up to 52.56 minutes in a year and stay within its availability target; see<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/availability-table#appendix_table-of-nines" data-type="xref">Availability Table</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>for a table.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">At Google, however, a time-based metric for availability is usually not meaningful because we are looking across globally distributed services. Our approach to fault isolation makes it very likely that we are serving at least a subset of traffic for a given service somewhere in the world at any given time (i.e., we are at least partially "up" at all times). Therefore, instead of using metrics around uptime, we define availability in terms of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">request success rate</EM>.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/#risk-management_measuring-service-risk_aggregate-availability-equation" data-type="xref">Aggregate availability</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>shows how this yield-based metric is calculated over a rolling window (i.e., proportion of successful requests over a one-day window).</P>
