<b> : </b>Risk Tolerance of Services</H1>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">What does it mean to identify the risk tolerance of a service? In a formal environment or in the case of safety-critical systems, the risk tolerance of services is typically built directly into the basic product or service definition. At Google, services&#8217; risk tolerance tends to be less clearly defined.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">To identify the risk tolerance of a service, SREs must work with the product owners to turn a set of business goals into explicit objectives to which we can engineer. In this case, the business goals we&#8217;re concerned about have a direct impact on the performance and reliability of the service offered. In practice, this translation is easier said than done. While consumer services often have clear product owners, it is unusual for infrastructure services (e.g., storage systems or a general-purpose HTTP caching layer) to have a similar structure of product ownership. We&#8217;ll discuss the consumer and infrastructure cases in turn.</P><SECTION id=identifying-the-risk-tolerance-of-consumer-services-o8sytAcy data-type="sect2">
