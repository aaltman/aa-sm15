<b> : </b>Target level of availability</H3>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">The target level of availability for a given Google service usually depends on the function it provides and how the service is positioned in the marketplace. The following list includes issues to consider:</P>
<UL style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 55px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">What level of service will the users expect?</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Does this service tie directly to revenue (either our revenue, or our customers&#8217; revenue)?</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Is this a paid service, or is it free?</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">If there are competitors in the marketplace, what level of service do those competitors provide?</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Is this service targeted at consumers, or at enterprises?</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Consider the requirements of Google Apps for Work. The majority of its users are enterprise users, some large and some small. These enterprises depend on Google Apps for Work services (e.g., Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs) to provide tools that enable their employees to perform their daily work. Stated another way, an outage for a Google Apps for Work service is an outage not only for Google, but also for all the enterprises that critically depend on us. For a typical Google Apps for Work service, we might set an external quarterly availability target of 99.9%, and back this target with a stronger internal availability target and a contract that stipulates penalties if we fail to deliver to the external target.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">YouTube provides a contrasting set of considerations. When Google acquired YouTube, we had to decide on the appropriate availability target for the website. In 2006, YouTube was focused on consumers and was in a very different phase of its business lifecycle than Google was at the time. While YouTube already had a great product, it was still changing and growing rapidly. We set a lower availability target for YouTube than for our enterprise products because rapid feature development was correspondingly more important.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=types-of-failures-vJsDTwtecQ data-type="sect3">
