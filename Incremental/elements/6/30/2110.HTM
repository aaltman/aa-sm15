<b> : </b>Other service metrics</H3>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Examining the risk tolerance of services in relation to metrics besides availability is often fruitful. Understanding which metrics are important and which metrics aren&#8217;t important provides us with degrees of freedom when attempting to take thoughtful risks.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Service latency for our Ads systems provides an illustrative example. When Google first launched Web Search, one of the service&#8217;s key distinguishing features was speed. When we introduced AdWords, which displays advertisements next to search results, a key requirement of the system was that the ads should not slow down the search experience. This requirement has driven the engineering goals in each generation of AdWords systems and is treated as an invariant.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">AdSense, Google&#8217;s ads system that serves contextual ads in response to requests from JavaScript code that publishers insert into their websites, has a very different latency goal. The latency goal for AdSense is to avoid slowing down the rendering of the third-party page when inserting contextual ads. The specific latency target, then, is dependent on the speed at which a given publisher&#8217;s page renders. This means that AdSense ads can generally be served hundreds of milliseconds slower than AdWords ads.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">This looser serving latency requirement has allowed us to make many smart trade-offs in provisioning (i.e., determining the quantity and locations of serving resources we use), which save us substantial cost over naive provisioning. In other words, given the relative insensitivity of the AdSense service to moderate changes in latency performance, we are able to consolidate serving into fewer geographical locations, reducing our operational overhead.</P></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION id=identifying-the-risk-tolerance-of-infrastructure-services-g0sxhdc2 data-type="sect2">
