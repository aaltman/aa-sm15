<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Unreliable systems can quickly erode users&#8217; confidence, so we want to reduce the chance of system failure. However, <FONT class=extract>experience shows that as we build systems, cost does not increase linearly as reliability increments&#8212;an incremental improvement in reliability may cost 100x more than the previous increment. The costliness has two dimensions:</FONT></P>

<DD style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px"><FONT class=extract>The cost borne by an organization when it allocates engineering resources to build systems or features that diminish risk instead of features that are directly visible to or usable by end users.

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">In SRE, we manage service reliability largely by managing risk. <FONT class=extract>We conceptualize risk as a continuum. We give equal importance to figuring out how to engineer greater reliability into Google systems and identifying the appropriate level of tolerance for the services we run. Doing so allows us to perform a cost/benefit analysis to determine, for example, where on the (nonlinear) risk continuum we should place Search, Ads, Gmail, or Photos. Our goal is to explicitly align the risk taken by a given service with the risk the business is willing to bear. We strive to make a service reliable enough, but no<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: normal">more</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>reliable than it needs to be.</FONT> That is, when we set an availability target of 99.99%,we want to exceed it, but not by much: that would waste opportunities to add features to the system, clean up technical debt, or reduce its operational costs. In a sense, we view the availability target as both a minimum and a maximum. The key advantage of this framing is that it unlocks explicit, thoughtful risktaking.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=measuring-service-risk-XQsyTn data-type="sect1">
