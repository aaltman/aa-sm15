<b> : </b>Cost</H3>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">Cost is often the key factor in determining the appropriate availability target for a service. Ads is in a particularly good position to make this trade-off because request successes and failures can be directly translated into revenue gained or lost. In determining the availability target for each service, we ask questions such as:</P>
<UL style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 55px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">If we were to build and operate these systems at one more nine of availability, what would our incremental increase in revenue be?</LI>
<LI style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Does this additional revenue offset the cost of reaching that level of reliability?</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">To make this trade-off equation more concrete, consider the following cost/benefit for an example service where each request has equal value:</P>
<UL class=simplelist style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 55px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px">
<LI style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Proposed improvement in availability target: 99.9% &#8594; 99.99%</LI>
<LI style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Proposed increase in availability: 0.09%</LI>
<LI style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Service revenue: $1M</LI>
<LI style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; PADDING-BOTTOM: 25px">Value of improved availability: $1M * 0.0009 = $900</LI></UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">In this case, if the cost of improving availability by one nine is less than $900, it is worth the investment. If the cost is greater than $900, the costs will exceed the projected increase in revenue.</P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px">It may be harder to set these targets when we do not have a simple translation function between reliability and revenue. One useful strategy may be to consider the background error rate of ISPs on the Internet. If failures are being measured from the end-user perspective and it is possible to drive the error rate for the service below the background error rate, those errors will fall within the noise for a given user&#8217;s Internet connection. While there are significant differences between ISPs and protocols (e.g., TCP versus UDP, IPv4 versus IPv6), we&#8217;ve measured the typical background error rate for ISPs as falling between 0.01% and 1%.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=other-service-metrics-nqsXipt8c1 data-type="sect3">
