Because he cared about what was going on, he started gently questioning other teammates about their contributions. He sent simple code reviews by email, politely asking about design assumptions or pointing out places where logic could be improved. After a couple of weeks, he was summoned to his director&#8217;s office. &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; Joe asked. &#8220;Did I do something wrong?&#8221; The director looked concerned: &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of complaints about your behavior, Joe. Apparently, you&#8217;ve been really harsh toward your teammates, criticizing them left and right. They&#8217;re upset. You need to tone it down.&#8221; Joe was utterly baffled. Surely, he thought, his code reviews should have been welcomed and appreciated by his peers. In this case, however, Joe should have been more sensitive to the team&#8217;s widespread insecurity and should have used a subtler means to introduce code reviews into the culture&#8212;perhaps even something as simple as discussing the idea with the team in advance and asking team members to try it out for a few weeks.</P>

The latter is useless&#8212;it&#8217;s petty and nearly impossible to act on. The former can (and should!) be helpful and give guidance on how to improve. And, most important, it&#8217;s imbued with respect: the person giving the constructive criticism genuinely cares about the other person and wants them to improve themselves or their work. Learn to respect your peers and give constructive criticism politely. If you truly respect someone, you&#8217;ll be motivated to choose tactful, helpful phrasing&#8212;a skill acquired with much practice.

This means not just being humble about your skills, but trusting that the other person has your best interests (and those of your project!) at heart and doesn&#8217;t actually think you&#8217;re an idiot. Programming is a skill like anything else: it improves with practice. If a peer pointed out ways in which you could improve your juggling, would you take it as an attack on your character and value as a human being? We hope not. In the same way, your self-worth shouldn&#8217;t be connected to the code you write&#8212;or any creative project you build.
