It turns out that past a certain point, however, increasing reliability is worse for a service (and its users) rather than better! Extreme reliability comes at a cost: maximizing stability limits how fast new features can be developed and how quickly products can be delivered to users, and dramatically increases their cost, which in turn reduces the numbers of features a team can afford to offer. Further, users typically don&#8217;t notice the difference between high reliability and extreme reliability in a service, because the user experience is dominated by less reliable components like the cellular network or the device they are working with. Put simply, a user on a 99% reliable smartphone cannot tell the difference between 99.99% and 99.999% service reliability! With this in mind, rather than simply maximizing uptime, Site Reliability Engineering seeks to balance the risk of unavailability with the goals of rapid innovation and efficient service operations, so that users&#8217; overall happiness&#8212;with features, service, and performance&#8212;is optimized.</FONT></P><SECTION id=managing-risk-OKsGh8 data-type="sect1">

Service failures can have many potential effects, including user dissatisfaction, harm, or loss of trust; direct or indirect revenue loss; brand or reputational impact; and undesirable press coverage.

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>One way to satisfy these competing constraints in a cost-effective manner is to partition the infrastructure and offer it at multiple independent levels of service. In the Bigtable example, we can build two types of clusters: low-latency clusters and throughput clusters. The low-latency clusters are designed to be operated and used by services that need low latency and high reliability. To ensure short queue lengths and satisfy more stringent client isolation requirements, the Bigtable system can be provisioned with a substantial amount of slack capacity for reduced contention and increased redundancy. The throughput clusters, on the other hand, can be provisioned to run very hot and with less redundancy, optimizing throughput over latency. In practice, we are able to satisfy these relaxed needs at a much lower cost, perhaps as little as 10&#8211;50% of the cost of a low-latency cluster. Given Bigtable&#8217;s massive scale, this cost savings becomes significant very quickly.</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>The key strategy with regards to infrastructure is to deliver services with explicitly delineated levels of service, thus enabling the clients to make the right risk and cost trade-offs when building their systems. With explicitly delineated levels of service, the infrastructure providers can effectively externalize the difference in the cost it takes to provide service at a given level to clients. Exposing cost in this way motivates the clients to choose the level of service with the lowest cost that still meets their needs. For example, Google+ can decide to put data critical to enforcing user privacy in a high-availability, globally consistent datastore (e.g., a globally replicated SQL-like system like Spanner<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></FONT><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(67,136,255)" href="https://sre.google/sre-book/bibliography#Cor12" data-type="xref"><FONT class=extract>[Cor12]</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), while putting optional data (data that isn&#8217;t critical, but that enhances the user experience) in a cheaper, less reliable, less fresh, and eventually consistent datastore (e.g., a NoSQL store with best-effort replication like Bigtable).</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>Note that we can run multiple classes of services using identical hardware and software.

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>To demonstrate that these risk-tolerance assessment principles do not just apply to storage infrastructure, let&#8217;s look at another large class of service: Google&#8217;s frontend infrastructure. The frontend infrastructure consists of reverse proxy and load balancing systems running close to the edge of our network. These are the systems that, among other things, serve as one endpoint of the connections from end users (e.g., terminate TCP from the user&#8217;s browser). Given their critical role, we engineer these systems to deliver an extremely high level of reliability. While consumer services can often limit the visibility of unreliability in backends, these infrastructure systems are not so lucky. If a request never makes it to the application service frontend server, it is lost.</FONT></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>Other chapters in this book discuss how tensions can arise between product development teams and SRE teams, given that they are generally evaluated on different metrics. Product development performance is largely evaluated on product velocity, which creates an incentive to push new code as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, SRE performance is (unsurprisingly) evaluated based upon reliability of a service, which implies an incentive to push back against a high rate of change. Information asymmetry between the two teams further amplifies this inherent tension. The product developers have more visibility into the time and effort involved in writing and releasing their code, while the SREs have more visibility into the service&#8217;s reliability (and the state of production in general).</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>These tensions often reflect themselves in different opinions about the level of effort that should be put into engineering practices. The following list presents some typical tensions:</FONT></P>

If SLO violations occur frequently enough to expend the error budget, releases are temporarily halted while additional resources are invested in system testing and development to make the system more resilient, improve its performance, and so on.

<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>For example, if product development wants to skimp on testing or increase push velocity and SRE is resistant, the error budget guides the decision. When the budget is large, the product developers can take more risks. When the budget is nearly drained, the product developers themselves will push for more testing or slower push velocity, as they don&#8217;t want to risk using up the budget and stall their launch. In effect, the product development team becomes self-policing. They know the budget and can manage their own risk. (Of course, this outcome relies on an SRE team having the authority to actually stop launches if the SLO is broken.)</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px"><FONT class=extract>What happens if a network outage or datacenter failure reduces the measured SLO? Such events also eat into the error budget.
