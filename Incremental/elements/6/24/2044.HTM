It&#8217;s tempting to focus all of your energy on the technical side of your team because, as an individual contributor, you spend the vast majority of your time solving technical problems. When you were a student, your classes were all about learning the technical ins and outs of your work. Now that you&#8217;re a manager, however, you ignore the human element of your team at your own peril.</P>

Years ago, Jake had his first child. Jake and Katie had worked together for years, both remotely and in the same office, so in the weeks following the arrival of the new baby, Jake worked from home. This worked out great for the couple, and Katie was totally fine with it because she was already used to working remotely with Jake. They were their usual productive selves until their manager, Pablo (who worked in a different office), found out that Jake was working from home for most of the week. Pablo was upset that Jake wasn&#8217;t going into the office to work with Katie, despite the fact that Jake was just as productive as always and that Katie was fine with the situation. Jake attempted to explain to Pablo that he was just as productive as he would be if he came into the office and that it was much easier on him and his wife for him to mostly work from home for a few weeks. Pablo&#8217;s response: &#8220;Dude, people have kids all the time. You need to go into the office.&#8221; Needless to say, Jake (normally a mild-mannered engineer) was enraged and lost a lot of respect for Pablo.</P>

He could have negotiated that Jake go into the office for one or two days a week until things settled down. Regardless of the end result, a little bit of empathy would have gone a long way toward keeping Jake happy in this situation.</P></SECTION><SECTION id=antipattern_be_everyoneapostrophes_frie style='FONT-SIZE: 16px; TEXT-DECORATION: none; BORDER-TOP: 0px; FONT-FAMILY: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline; WORD-SPACING: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; FONT-WEIGHT: 300; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; DISPLAY: block; LINE-HEIGHT: 24px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit' data-type="sect2">
