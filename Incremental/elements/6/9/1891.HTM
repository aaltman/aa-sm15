<b> : </b>Methodology</H5>
<P>To find examples of metastability, we searched through troves of publicly available post-mortem incident reports from large cloud infrastructure providers and significantly smaller companies or services. Large infrastructure providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google, are held accountable by many paying customers, forcing greater transparency into their reliability and operation practices. Smaller businesses often operate with higher self-imposed transparency goals until they grow large enough to become a significant target for malicious attacks.</P>
<P>Infrastructure providers often maintain incident and outage reporting tools, which became our primary source for metastable failures. We analyzed hundreds of incidents to find a handful that depicts systems in the metastable state. We also found several smaller failures from other public sources such as postmortem communities, weekly outage incident digests, etc.</P>
<P>The reports from different sources do not follow the same format nor provide the same level of information, making our job of finding examples of metastability more difficult. While going through these reports, we focus on tell-tale signs of metastability&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;temporary triggers, work amplification or sustaining effects, and certain specific mitigation practices. More specifically, we look for patterns when a trigger initiates some processes that amplify the initial trigger-induced problem and sustain the degraded performance state even after the trigger is removed. The sustaining effect can take multiple forms, such as exacerbated queue growth or retries that create more load. We also pay attention to mitigation efforts, as metastable failures often require significant load shedding for recovery.</P>
<P>We perform a comprehensive analysis of these incidents, focusing on impact, trigger, work amplification mechanisms, and mitigation practices. To study the impact, we focus on the duration and number of impacted services. This information is usually readily available in the reports. For the triggers, we identify the triggers and classify them into several distinct categories. We use a similar identification and classification process to distill work-amplification mechanisms and mitigation patterns. We present our summarized findings in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; COLOR: rgb(3,57,216); BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent" href="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/metastability_in_the_wild.pdf">Table 1</A>.
