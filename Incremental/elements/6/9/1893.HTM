<b> : </b>Experiment Setup</H5>
<P>Our reproduction is a multi-threaded java program compiled via JDK 8 under default GC settings except we experiment with MaxHeapSize. Each thread processes a job consisting of many memory allocations. Each job allocates a 0.5MB array of arrays and then proceeds to allocate each row in this 2D array, adding an additional 0.5MB of data. Once a job completes, the allocated memory is unreferenced and will eventually be garbage collected. The main thread launches jobs following a Poisson process with a configured request rate measured in requests per second (RPS). We launch the java program in a docker container configured with 1GB of memory running on an AWS EC2 m5.large instance.
