<b> : </b>Mostly positive attitudes toward the EU</H3>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">One of the most significant political developments of the past three decades has been the integration of many Central and Eastern European nations into the European Union. Of course, another major development in recent years has been the rise of populist political parties and movements throughout Europe that have questioned the value of European integration and railed against Brussels on a variety of fronts. The United Kingdom has gone so far as to vote to leave the EU.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Overall, attitudes toward the EU are positive. Roughly half or more in every member state surveyed express a favorable opinion of the institution. The EU gets its highest ratings in Poland and Lithuania, two nations that did not join the union until 2004, and its third highest rating is in Bulgaria, which didn&#8217;t join until 2007. In the UK, Greece, Czech Republic and France, attitudes toward the EU are less positive, though still on balance favorable.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image aligncenter" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; TEXT-ALIGN: center; CLEAR: none; MARGIN: 0px auto 1em; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values-00-07/" rel="attachment wp-att-44564"><IMG class="not-transparent wp-image-44564" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #f0efef" alt="Largely positive views about the EU and its impact on member states" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-00-07.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="center" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="false" data-dominant-color="f0efef"></A></FIGURE>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">When asked to reflect on their country&#8217;s EU membership, respondents mostly say it has been a good thing, especially in Germany, Poland and Spain, where at least two-in-three express this view. In contrast, only half or fewer believe membership has been good in Italy, the UK and the Czech Republic.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Publics are somewhat more lukewarm about the economic impact of EU membership. When asked whether the economic integration of Europe has strengthened or weakened their country&#8217;s economy, a median of 56% across the 14 member states surveyed say it has strengthened it. However, just 42% in France, 35% in Greece, 25% in Bulgaria and 22% in Italy share this opinion.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Overall, views about the general impact of EU membership, and the specific economic impact of membership, have improved in recent years as economic concerns have eased somewhat in many nations. Even, for example, in a country like France, where there is still a lot of skepticism about the value of economic integration, opinions have improved &#8211; in 2015, just 31% felt integration had helped their economy, compared with the 42% registered in the current survey.
