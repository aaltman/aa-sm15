Regarding the economic prospects for the next generation, hope is more common in Central and Eastern Europe. Around six-in-ten Ukrainians, Poles and Slovaks believe that when children in their country grow up, they will be financially better off than their parents. In contrast, roughly a quarter or fewer hold this view in Greece, Spain, Italy, the UK and France.</P>

People are largely optimistic about the future of their country&#8217;s relations with other European nations, and they feel the same way about their country&#8217;s culture. However, there is considerably less optimism about the future regarding well-paying jobs and the way the political system works. European publics are especially pessimistic about reducing economic inequality &#8211; across the 14 EU nations surveyed, a median of just 23% are optimistic about reducing the gap between rich and poor in their country.
