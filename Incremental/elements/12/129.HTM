<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: 0px">Americans are more likely than Europeans to say most tenets of democracy are very important for the country, but especially the ability for the media to report without government censorship and freedom of religion. Americans are about as likely as Western Europeans to say that honest, regular elections with at least two parties are very important for their country, and both see this as more important than most in Eastern Europe.</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: var(--block-gap)">When it comes to attitudes about LGBT rights, Americans are generally more progressive than Central and Eastern Europeans. For example, today 72% of Americans say homosexuality should be accepted by society. While lower than the median of 86% in Western Europe, this is much higher than the median of 46% who say the same in Central and Eastern Europe.</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: var(--block-gap)">Regarding attitudes about individualism, Americans are less likely than Europeans to say forces outside of people&#8217;s control determine success in life.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV>
