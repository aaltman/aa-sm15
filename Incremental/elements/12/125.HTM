<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">Although Europeans tend to place a high priority on having gender equality in their countries, in several nations women are more likely than men to hold this view. In nine of the nations surveyed, women are especially likely to say it is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="BOX-SIZING: border-box">very&nbsp;</EM>important that women have the same rights as men in their country. Double-digit gender gaps on this question are found in Slovakia, Italy, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Russia, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</P>
<P style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 640px; MARGIN-LEFT: auto !important; MARGIN-RIGHT: auto !important; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px">In many European nations, attitudes toward gender roles and marriage have shifted since 1991, with more people now preferring a marriage where both the husband and wife have jobs and take care of the household, rather than one where the husband provides for the family and the wife takes care of home and children. For instance, in 1991, 57% of Poles preferred traditional marriage roles, compared with just 27% today.</P>
