<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: 0px">Around nine-in-ten Germans living in both the West and East say that German unification was a good thing for Germany. However, majorities on both sides of the former Iron Curtain say that since unification, East and West have not achieved the same standard of living.</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: var(--block-gap)">East Germans are less satisfied with the way democracy is working in Germany and the overall direction of the country than those in the West. And fewer East Germans have a favorable view of the European Union.</LI>
<LI style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; margin-block-start: var(--block-gap)">Life satisfaction in East Germany has skyrocketed since 1991 and now is closing in on opinions in the West. In 1991, 15% of those living in former East Germany said their life was a 7, 8, 9, or 10 on a 0-10 scale, but in 2019 that ballooned to 59%. Meanwhile, life satisfaction in the West has also increased since 1991, from 52% to 64% today.</LI></UL>
