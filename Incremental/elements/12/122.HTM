The improvement in several of the Central and Eastern European countries that have joined the EU is dramatic. In 1991, as Poland was still coming to grips with the transition to democracy and capitalism, just 12% of Poles rated their lives a 7, 8, 9 or 10 on a 0-10 scale, where 10 represents the best possible life and 0 the worst possible life. Today, 56% do so.</P><FIGURE class="wp-block-image aligncenter" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; TEXT-ALIGN: center; CLEAR: none; MARGIN: 0px auto 1em; DISPLAY: table; margin-block: 1.25rem 0px"><A style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; COLOR: ; border-radius: inherit" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/15/european-public-opinion-three-decades-after-the-fall-of-communism/pg_10-15-19-europe-values_updated2/" rel="attachment wp-att-44687"><IMG class="not-transparent wp-image-44687" style="BOX-SIZING: border-box; MAX-WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: auto; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; border-radius: inherit; --dominant-color: #ecebec" alt="Since 1991, life satisfaction has improved across Europe" src="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values_updated2.png" data-needs-sizes-update="" data-align="center" decoding="async" data-has-transparency="false" data-dominant-color="ecebec"></A></FIGURE>

Even though their countries have experienced economic challenges in recent years, people in France and Spain are much more positive about their lives than they were almost three decades ago.</P>

The four countries with the highest per capita incomes in this study &#8211; the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden &#8211; also have the highest levels of life satisfaction, while the nation with the lowest per capita income, Ukraine, has the lowest level.
